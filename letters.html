I feel that that\nis a win because that means that we&#39;re driving the bus right down the middle of\nthe field.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now, ignoring his odd desire to drive a bus through a field, that sounds\nsensible, right?  It&#39;s perhaps a little cowardly, but there&#39;s often a desire to\nfind a middle-ground between two extremes.  What&#39;s wrong with that?</p>\n<p>It&#39;s simple: there is no middle ground.  Don and Scott are saying the <em>exact\nsame thing</em>!</p>\n<p>While we forcefully disagree about many things, we are in harmony in\nunderstanding that questions 6 – 11 substantially rearrange Andover&#39;s power\nstructures, taking authority away from you and me and handing it to the BOS and\nTown Administrator.  With all due respect to the revision commission&#39;s hard\nwork, the process was too rushed and the results show it.</p>\n<p>Many ballot questions sound reasonable but are extremely misleading.  The text\nalters much more than the questions express.  It makes sense to move seven days,\naligning the town budget vote with the RHAM one; why does this mean other\nprocesses move <em>thirty</em> days?  Why does it mean the Town Administrator gets\nfirst crack at the budgets, inluding the AES one?  Why does it mean the Board of\nFinance&#39;s authority gets watered down, adding the BOS to their hearing?  What\nlanguage would the charter include if Question 10 passes but 7 and 8 do not?\nWhy would we want to strip voters&#39; right to choose a Town Clerk and to decide on\nproposed ordinances?</p>\n<p>There is no middle ground.  We both urge everyone to vote no on Questions 6 –\n11.</p>\n"

Questions 7 – 10 are out-and-out lies.  I&#39;ve\nposted <a href=\"http://charter.andoverct.info/2024/\">http://charter.andoverct.info/2024/</a> describing the charter changes, but\nif you want the original sources, you can see the actual charter changes at\n<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/120\">http://link.sauyet.com/120</a> and the ballot questions at\n<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/121\">http://link.sauyet.com/121</a>.</p>\n<p>Read Questions 7 – 10, then read the changes to sections 802 and 803, and then\ntry to figure out which changes are tied to which questions.  Try perhaps to\nanswer these questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Which ballot question is tied to the deletion of Sections 802B(2) and\n802B(3), the sections that described the format of the budget presented to the\nTown Meeting?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Which ballot question replaces the Board of Finance with the Town\nAdministrator as the recipient of the departments&#39; expenditure estimates? (802C)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Which ballot question necessitates the new 802D, which replaces the BOF\nbudget hearing with a joint BOS/BOF meeting, at which the presence of just three\nSelectmen would constitute a quorum?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t do it.  The Board of Selectmen couldn&#39;t do it either at\ntheir public hearing Monday.  Instead, they just asked you to trust them.\nRemember Reagan&#39;s dictum?  &quot;Trust, but verify.&quot;  Well I&#39;ve done the verification\nmyself.  The questions don&#39;t come <em>close</em> to describing the relevant changes.\nDon&#39;t take my word, though.  Please check it out for yourself.</p>\n<p>The worst part of this is that most of those questions on their own suggest\nreasonable changes.  By not describing the actual charter changes involved, they\nare trying to fool us.  Don&#39;t be taken in.</p>\n<p>Also, don&#39;t let them take away your right to vote for the Town Clerk (Question\n6), or to weigh in on town ordinances (Question 11.)</p>\n<p>Vote No on 6 – 11!</p>\n"

    "Content": "<p>Has it happened?  Has hell finally frozen over?  Do <a href=\"#/person/Don+Denley/\">Don Denley</a> and Scott Sauyet\nfinally agree on something?</p>\n<p>Yes!  We both think the significant proposed changes to Andover&#39;s charter are\nterrible.  They represent an institutional power grab.  Buried in the middle,\nafter a few innocent questions and before a few arguably reasonable questions\nare six questions that threaten the fabric of our New England Town Meeting.</p>\n<p>Question 1 is about the state Constitution, not our charter.  Questions 2 – 5\nand 16 are simple and obviously good changes.  Questions 12 – 15 discuss\nfinancial thresholds requiring a Town Meeting.  Personally, I&#39;m happy with 12 –\n14, not 15.</p>\n<p>But questions 6 – 11 represent a fundamental shift in our democracy.</p>\n<p>Question 6 gives up your right to select the Town Clerk.  Does anyone even\nremember a time when our elected Town Clerk wasn&#39;t wonderful?</p>\n<p>Question 11 gives up your right to control local ordinances.  The proposal\nstrips this authority from the Town Meeting and gives it to the Board of\nSelectmen.  They&#39;ll pretend that with only 50 votes necessary (really 116, a\nmajority of a minimal quorum) to petition to overturn the ordinance, the power\nis still in voters hands.  That&#39;s nonsense.  It&#39;s a power grab.</p>\n<p>At least those two questions are straightforward.  Questions 7 – 10 are\ninsidious.  They ask innocuous-looking questions, burying the fact that they are\ntaking authority away from you, the Board of Finance, and the local Board of\nEducation, giving it to the Town Administrator and Board of Selectmen.  Read\nespecially Sections 802 and 803.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve posted an overview of the proposed charter.  You can see it at\n<a href=\"http://charter.andoverct.info/2024/\">http://charter.andoverct.info/2024/</a>.

Simple: she&#39;s hard-working, knowledgeable,\ncompassionate, extremely organized, faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap\ntall buildings in a single bound... or am I mixing up my heroes?</p>\n<p>Amanda is out there knocking on doors; if she hasn&#39;t hit yours, you can bet\nshe&#39;s talked to a neighbor.  She does this so she can get to know the community\nbetter, and the community can get to know her.  That might be redundant.  If you\nknow any involved, caring, active member of your community, you understand who\nAmanda is.  If you&#39;re a hard-working, upstanding citizen, Amanda understands who\nyou are.</p>\n<p>Amanda has a great backstory.  A lifelong Republican, chair of her party, she\nbecame disillusioned with the direction of Republicans.  When her son asked how\nshe could support the party that wanted to marginalize and oppress a friend of\nhis, she realized she was done, and quit the party.  To make sure that no one\ncould ever be demoralized by such Republican bullying, she ran for office.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#/person/Steve+Weir/\">Steve Weir</a> is different.  His supporters only find two things good to say: he&#39;s\na nice guy and he never missed a vote.  Being a nice guy is great.  Amanda is\nawfully nice too, though.  Not missing a vote is fine, but hardly a major\nvirtue.</p>\n<p>Steve is a champion of businesses.  Amanda is a champion of the people.  Steve\nis a proud member of the Conservative Caucus.  Amanda supports mainstream\npositions: socially liberal, fiscally conservative.  Steve&#39;s idea of getting to\nknow the community is to fly around in his personal helicopter looking down at\neveryone.  Amanda will knock on your door and sit down at your kitchen table.</p>\n<p>I want a queen bee, not a drone.  I&#39;m proudly voting for Amanda V for the 55th!</p>\n"

    "Content": "<p>Some weeks ago, I received a flier from <a href=\"#/person/Steve+Weir/\">Steve Weir</a> touting his legislative\naccomplishments representing the 55th State House District.  Let&#39;s take a look.</p>\n<p>He starts with a list of bills that <em>didn&#39;t</em> pass this session.  It is slightly\nodd, but not inconceivable, that one&#39;s strongest accomplishment is in blocking\nbills from passing.  So, was he a master manipulator who targeted some terrible\nbills, managing the sausage-making and causing all five of these bills to go\ndown?  Well, no.  These bills passed through committee (over his objection), but\nnot one of them made it to a floor vote.  Steve Weir had little to do with them\nfailing.</p>\n<p>Then he gushes about seven bills that did become law.  Was this his great\nlegislative achievement, shepherding tough bills through Hartford&#39;s\nmeat-grinder?  Again, no.  With one exception, these bills were passed\n<em>unanimously</em>.  That one? 146-3 in the House, 36-0 in the Senate.</p>\n<p>So Steve&#39;s proud accomplishments are losing some committee votes on bills that\nnever reached the floor and boldly siding with every one of his colleagues on\nsome others?  Is this really what we want our legislators to be proud of?  To my\nmind a successful legislator is one who can help pass the difficult bills, one\nwho can sway colleagues with superior logic, even one who goes down swinging,\nforcing others to at least <em>understand</em> the objections.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the flier we learn that Steve loves children and librarians.  Bully\nfor him!  And we learn a little about vanity: the flier contains fourteen\nseparate photos of Steve.  But mostly it&#39;s about these legislative so-called\naccomplishments.  What a waste of paper.</p>\n<p>I, for one, do not want to be represented by a drone.  I want a queen bee.

Perhaps I owe an explanation.</p>\n<p>Four decades ago, when I became a Quaker, I took to heart their teachings\nagainst oaths.  Quakers say we should not proffer two kinds of truths: everyday\nones and those we really mean because we swear to them.  Quakers take Jesus&#39;\nwords seriously: &quot;But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for\nit is God&#39;s throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool...&quot; (<em>Matthew\n5:34-35</em>).  These concerns by Quakers and other like-minded citizens are built\ninto our laws.  The right to affirm rather than swear is in the Constitution and\nin the very first section of the U.S. Legal Code.</p>\n<p>The Pledge of Allegiance is an oath.  I do not take oaths.  The right not to do\nso was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1943.  Mr. Denley&#39;s implication that I\nshould do so because of Robert&#39;s Rules is bizarre.  Robert&#39;s Rules certainly do\nnot insist that anyone participates.  His implication that I bring dishonor to\nAndover by my actions demonstrates a terrible misunderstanding of honor.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to have this discussion at a time when the MAGA movement is\npledging its allegiance not to our Republic, but to an autocrat bent on\ndestroying it.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is very odd to be chided over this by a self-described conservative.\nConservatives generally promote individual freedom and deplore any form of\ncollectivism.  Why is Mr. Denley bothered that I refuse to participate in a\nritual designed to coerce uniformity of belief?</p>\n",

It is also one of the premier political fact-checking sites,\nalthough it has plenty of competitors in this, including factcheck.org and\npolitifact.com.  When I used Snopes references to discredit Mr. McNamara&#39;s post,\nhis response was simply to attack Snopes.  That there was infighting and\nplagiarism among Snopes&#39; founders does nothing to dispute the organization&#39;s\ncurrent prominent place among fact-checkers.</p>\n<p>Snopes is a verified member of the International Fact Checking Network, which\nmeans they&#39;re known to &quot;exhibit a commitment to nonpartisanship and fairness,\ntransparency of sources, transparency of funding and organization, transparency\nof methodology, and a commitment to open and honest corrections.&quot;</p>\n<p>He claims that by labeling stories as false, Snopes (and Facebook) are censoring\nstories and stifling dissent.  No, what Snopes is doing is something called\n&quot;journalism&quot;.  Those steeped in right-wing media may not recognize this term,\nbut it&#39;s an important way our society discovers and promotes &quot;truth&quot;, another\nword that seems a little fuzzy to them.  Facebook, as I understand it, bans\nlittle, but refuses to promote provably false dangerous stories.  He tries to\nget snide, critiquing them for debunking a common myth, he misses the point:\n&quot;Sugar Causes Hyperactivity in Children&quot; is widely believed, but according to\nscientific research is false.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, I rebutted three specific claims using references to\nfact-checkers&#39; articles.  That he still disagrees does not say anything about\nfact-checkers, no matter how much he blames the messenger.  But it says a great\ndeal about him.</p>\n<p>There is truth; I know it&#39;s hard for Mr. McNamara to accept it.  He really must\nlearn.

I&#39;m\ngetting tired of doing it for you!</p>\n<p>Mr. McNamara claims that the CDC released an entirely redacted, 148-page report\non the relationship of a Covid vaccine and myocarditis.  Snopes says, &quot;False&quot;.\nYes, there was an entirely redacted document, but it was not such a report.\nInstead, it was a collection of inter- and intra-agency communications exempt\nfrom Freedom of Information requests.</p>\n<p>He claims that the Covid vaccine inserts are entirely blank.  AP News says,\n&quot;False.&quot;  Instead, for the duration of the vaccine&#39;s emergency use\nauthorization, with information changing quickly, the inserts simply pointed to\nthe up-do-date information online.</p>\n<p>And he claims that Pfizer petitioned the court to keep their COVID vaccine trial\ndata secret for 75 years.  Again, false.  Snopes explains that the FDA (not\nPfizer) responded to a Freedom of Information Act request with their standard\nschedule of releasing 500 pages per month.  But because the request was so broad\n-- over 300,000 pages -- it would take decades to complete.  A judge ruled that\nthey must go much faster, completing in eight months.</p>\n<p>It only took me a few minutes to look these things up, read the articles, and\nunderstand that Mr. McNamara was putting his faith in untrustworthy sources.\nWhy couldn&#39;t he check this on his own?

    "Content": "<p><a href=\"#/person/C.+Anne+Johnson/\">C. Anne Johnson</a> has again failed Fact-Checking 101.</p>\n<p>The recent case before the Supreme Court is <em>Murthy vs. Missouri</em>.  The Court\nseems likely to overturn it, as the effect of that decision is to forbid most\ngovernment contact with social media companies.  The ostensible problem it was\nsolving was that the government was asking companies like Facebook and Twitter\nto stop promoting false and dangerous misinformation about topics like Covid and\nelections.</p>\n<p>The 5th Circuit accepted the ridiculous notion that this is censorship.  Both\nplatforms -- and I assume others like Instagram and TikTok as well -- had\npolicies of not promoting clear falsehoods that threatened public harm.  All the\ngovernment was doing was calling attention to such content.  This rarely\ninvolved taking down these posts; usually it meant adding warning labels and/or\navoiding oversharing such posts.  Generally, only posts specifically advocating\nviolence are removed.</p>\n<p>This is not censorship.  Censorship is <em>the government</em> preventing people from\nspeaking their minds.  Helping social media companies identify dangerous, false\nposts is not censorship.  The First Amendment doesn&#39;t grant you the right to\npublish whatever you want on a social media site... unless you own one.  It\ndoesn&#39;t even grant you the right to publish letters in <em>The Rivereast</em>.  That&#39;s\nup to its editors and owners.  Facebook and Twitter CEOs actually <em>asked</em>\nCongress for regulations.</p>\n<p>HR-4310 -- a bipartisan bill, by the way -- does not promote propaganda inside\nthe US.  Reputable fact-checkers have already debunked this, which Ms. Johnson\ncould easily have found out if she&#39;d bothered looking.

    "Content": "<p>Remember the <em>For Dummies</em> books, tutoring those without relevant background?\nOr <em>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide</em> series, for those understanding even less than\nthe dummies?  I propose a new series for the still more clueless: <em>For MAGAs</em>.\nHere&#39;s a snippet from <em>Debating for MAGAs</em>, in response to Don Denley&#39;s latest\nincoherency.</p>\n<p>Lesson 1: We understand that whining about perceived slights makes you <em>feel</em>\nbigger -- more Trump-like, I suppose. But claiming conspiracy in the placement\nof your letters makes you <em>look</em> much smaller.  Rivereast archives are online;\ndouble-check before putting your foot in your mouth.  As recently as December\n8th you&#39;ll find Ed Kozlowski and Frank Blume on page 7, Ed Smith and me on 32.</p>\n<p>Lesson 2: Before saying, &quot;He said A and B, and he&#39;s completely wrong; here&#39;s the\nevidence against B,&quot; please double-check. &quot;A&quot;: Most people thought the economy\nwas bad, but not for themselves.  &quot;B&quot;: Inflation has been lower under Biden.\nThe trouble is, I said &quot;A&quot;, and supplied evidence; you offer no dispute.  But I\ndidn&#39;t say &quot;B&quot;. Go ahead and reread.  To play &quot;Gotcha&quot;, you must understand the\nfacts.  We know it&#39;s difficult for MAGAs, but please try!</p>\n<p>Lesson 3: Don&#39;t obsess over a fault in one while overlooking it in another.\nBiden has long been known for verbal gaffes. They pale in comparison to Trump&#39;s.\nBiden confused certain foreign leaders?  Trump can&#39;t keep his current\ncompetitors straight, confusing Haley and Pelosi, mixing up Biden, Obama, and\nClinton.  Watching his befuddlement is excruciating.</p>\n<p>Lesson 4: We know math isn&#39;t MAGAs&#39; strong suit.  We sympathize; it&#39;s\nchallenging to have no clue.  But it&#39;s ridiculous to discuss how a $1.4 billion\nprogram will affect taxpayers (maybe $5), a mere rounding error against the $2\ntrillion debt from Trump&#39;s Tax Scam giveaway.</p>\n<p>Also, coming soon: <em>Empathy for MAGAs</em>.</p>\n"

But by every measure -- except inflation, which\naffected all our peer nations, and is now under control -- it&#39;s been better\nunder Biden.  Trump has been publicly rooting <em>against</em> our economy.  He is\nperfectly happy to inflict misery on everyone to win votes.  Supporting Trump is\nsupporting anti-American political extortion.</p>\n<p>(A note to <a href=\"#/person/Don+Denley/\">Don Denley</a>: yes, people say the economy is bad; they also say their\nown finances are fine.  The disconnect demonstrates the gullible believing\nright-wing media&#39;s incessant lies; that doesn&#39;t make it true.)</p>\n<p>They follow Trump&#39;s lead and talk about crime rates.  Outside a little blip that\nstarted with the pandemic, they&#39;ve been falling for decades, and 2023 had the\nsharpest drop in murder rate on record.  But the facts won&#39;t stop their\nscreaming.  Supporting Trump is supporting unjustified paranoia.</p>\n<p>Then they focus on immigration.  When the Democrats gave the Republicans\neverything they wanted in an immigration bill, Congressional Trump supporters\nnixed the bill because it might help Biden politically.  This is not\nspeculation; they said it out loud.  They claim Biden can do it all via\nexecutive orders.  Remember when Obama set immigration rules through executive\norders?  They went through the roof.  But they were silent when Trump did so.\nSupporting Trump is supporting crass manipulation.</p>\n<p>Now Trump says he&#39;d let Putin invade certain NATO allies.  Those supporters will\nclaim justification, as evident in <a href=\"#/person/Ken+Hjulstrom/\">Ken Hjulstrom</a>&#39;s notion that Trump is a\nhorrible human being but that&#39;s what we need right now.

After all, it&#39;s refreshing that he presents actual content\ninstead of his usual vacuity.  That content is false, but still it&#39;s an\nimprovement.</p>\n<p>First, he won&#39;t scare me by claiming to be good at mathematics.  I have two\nmath degrees.</p>\n<p>Second, we need to explain something to those who don&#39;t understand math... or\neconomics... or government... or much else:  A president&#39;s first budget takes\neffect October 1<sup>st</sup>.  Earlier economic effects are the result of their\npredecessor or of factors outside Presidential control.  Perhaps the fairest\ncomparison is between the 27 months starting with those Octobers.  Including\nthe mishandled pandemic period would be infinitely worse for Trump.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kozlowski focuses on inflation.  It&#39;s risen faster under Biden (by 4.7%\nannually) than in recent years, but is below the increase in wages (up 5.1% per\nyear).  Most people are better off.  However yes: food&#39;s gone up faster (6.9%)\nthan wages.  Job creation, though, was twice as fast for Biden than for Trump.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s amusing that he&#39;d blame Biden for lumber prices, which are due to booming\nhome improvements during the Covid lockdown and to Trump&#39;s&#39; tariffs on Canadian\nlumber.  But it&#39;s hilarious because since the start of Biden&#39;s first budget,\nlumber prices have <em>fallen</em> 8.6% annually, where they rose to crazy heights\nduring Trump&#39;s budgets, doubling before settling down.</p>\n<p>He claims spiraling debt; funny, it rose 8.3% per year under Biden, 8.9% per\nyear under Trump.  He blames Biden for the invasion of Ukraine, when everyone\nknows that Trump&#39;s puppet-master, Putin, was responsible.  He mentions a Biden\ngaffe; the continuing stream of gaffes from Trump is infinitely worse.</p>\n<p>Yeah, a funny guy all right.</p>\n",

First, thanks for the election congratulations -- it&#39;s hard to lose when running unopposed, though.  That he wouldn&#39;t have voted for me does not wound me deeply, I&#39;m afraid.  I will still do my best for all the children, including any he might have.</p>\n<p>When I point out the Andover Republican&#39;s misattributed quote, his response boils down to, &quot;Well, it <em>sounds</em> like Jefferson.&quot;  Then he goes on to lecture us about proper quotation!</p>\n<p>He critiques my vocabulary, saying &quot;peccadilloes&quot; is too long a word.  I really don&#39;t feel it&#39;s all that uncommon.  But be careful, or I&#39;ll start using sesquipedalian ones!</p>\n<p>Finally -- and I wouldn&#39;t have bothered responding except for this inspired piece of nonsense -- he uses the editor&#39;s placement of Frank Blume&#39;s &quot;Debts and Budgets&quot; letter next to my own as somehow proof that I don&#39;t care about a number of issues -- that I am focused exclusively on one issue.  Huh?  What?  I happen to have seventeen years of letters online; a list of the 200 topics discussed is at <a href=\"http://letters.sauyet.com/#/topics/\">http://letters.sauyet.com/#/topics/</a>.</p>\n<p>I am focused on different issues than Mr. Chotkowski.  He mentions a few concerns.  Inflation: it&#39;s now at 3.2%, lower than during the Reagan years and below wage growth.  A border-crisis: if we don&#39;t want a Japan-style economy, we probably should be <em>increasing</em> immigration.  Crime: violent crime rates have been falling for more than 30 years.  Drugs: agreed, there&#39;s a problem; can we go after the two most deadly ones first?  If we can&#39;t reduce the harm from tobacco and alcohol, what hope do we have for fentanyl or heroin?</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t sign off without pointing out that he accuses me of not being conservative.  Well, duh!</p>\n",

    "Content": "<p>It&#39;s no secret that the Republican party is a mess.  This is clear in the\nimportant issues of our time but also obvious in the small details.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s start small.  The Republicans hung a banner near Andover&#39;s recent\nelection.  Alongside traditional Republican logos and slogans, it quoted Thomas\nJefferson: &quot;A government big enough to give you everything you want, is big\nenough to take away everything you have.&quot;  Sure, a traditional small-government\nslogan, aligned perhaps with what the party stood for... once upon a time.</p>\n<p>Except, Thomas Jefferson never said that.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s very easy to check these things.  I pasted the first ten words of the quote\ninto popular search engines; the first hits -- including ones from the\ndefinitive Jefferson source, <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/\">https://www.monticello.org/</a> -- make it clear that\nJefferson never wrote this.  It&#39;s a small thing, to be sure.  But this is a\nreusable banner presumably meant to hang at many events.  You&#39;d think they&#39;d\ntake care before falsely attributing their propaganda to one of our country&#39;s\nFounders.</p>\n<p>If Republican problem were limited to such minor peccadilloes, it would be fine.\nBut it&#39;s not.  The House Republicans recently voted to send $14 billion in aid\nto Israel.  To offset the cost, they want to cut funding to the IRS.</p>\n<p>We don&#39;t need analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian situation to see how\nridiculous this is.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office&#39;s data says\nthat this would <em>increase</em> the deficit by about $14 billion, because without\nenforcement, tax cheats simply get away with it.  Think of the moral\nimplications: The Republican party says, &quot;Yes, we&#39;ll help out one of our closest\nallies, but only if you let us make a political point that will worsen our debt\nand help rich tax cheats.&quot;</p>\n<p>What a disaster!</p>\n",

It&#39;s looking increasingly possible that we&#39;ll cede our\nrepublican government to a modern fascism.</p>\n<p>Jim Jordan is a legislator who&#39;s spent sixteen years in office, creating no\nlegislation: not a single bill. The Center for Effective Lawmaking places him\nbelow 99% of his peers.</p>\n<p>Jim Jordan was a coach who overlooked the sexual harassment of his wrestlers.\nJim Jordan was the closest Congressional ally to Donald Trump and strived to\noverturn a fair election. Jim Jordan is determined to hold hostage our country&#39;s\nfinancial future in order to win concessions on his pet issues.</p>\n<p>In short, Jim Jordan is a menace.

You can\nvote out Republicans at all levels of government. If you have a local election\nnext month, vote Democrat, vote Independent, vote Green, vote Libertarian. If\nyou love your country, vote anything but Republican.</p>\n<p>If, like me, you live in Andover, consider the Democrat&#39;s slate of incredibly\ncompetent, compassionate, and experienced candidates. The best thing you could\ndo for your country is to vote against every Republican running anywhere until\nthe party comes to its senses. If we do this, perhaps we can make it look\nincreasingly possible that our country will heal from the divisions Newt\nGingrich started and modern Republicans are trying to finish.</p>\n<p>Vote Democratic!</p>\n"

Or we get a so-called\npresident whose continual lies incited an insurrection, and who, despite\nnumerous serious indictments, looks certain to win another nomination.</p>\n<p>When states elect Republicans, we get Florida banning books; excising\ndiscussions of slavery, Jim Crow, and George Floyd; and waging war with its\nlargest private employer -- and biggest tourist attraction -- simply because\nthey had the temerity to speak out for their gay employees.</p>\n<p>When Connecticut towns elect Republicans, we get the clown show in Colchester\ndescribed every week on these pages, with a mini-despot banning books,\nsingle-handedly conducting sham investigations into an employee for political\nreasons, tearing up agendas, screaming at voters, and who knows what else?

He brazenly calls\neveryone who disagrees with him -- including the military, insurance companies,\ncoastal states such as Florida and Texas, and the overwhelming majority of the\nscientific establishment -- uneducated buffoons.</p>\n<p>Notice also his sleight of hand here.  A decade ago, he argued that the Earth\nwas not warming.  Five years later, he admitted it was, but claimed\nhuman-released C02 was not responsible for it.

In three previous letters (details\nat <a href=\"#/pages/democracy\">http://letters.sauyet.com/#/pages/democracy</a>), I have corrected his &quot;not\na democracy, but a republic&quot; falshood.  But he repeats it again.</p>\n<p>He shares the familiar Benjamin Franklin story, conveniently ignoring the\nquestion asked: &quot;Doctor, what have we got? A republic or a monarchy?&quot;, which\ngives context for &quot;A Republic, if you can keep it.&quot;  That&#39;s the point.\nWebster&#39;s definition of <em>republic</em> is, &quot;a government having a chief of state who\nis not a monarch and who in modern times is usually a president.&quot;  So, yes,\nwe&#39;re a republic.</p>\n<p>Webster&#39;s definition of <em>democracy</em>: &quot;a government in which the supreme power is\nvested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a\nsystem of representation usually involving periodically held free elections.&quot;\nSo guess what?

As much as Sam Prentice\nwants to deny it, the constitution requires interpretation.  If he wants to\nstick to textualism, how would he rebut the contention that the Supreme Court\nhas no authority to strike down Connecticut gun laws.  After all, there is no\nreference to judicial review in the Constitution.  There&#39;s no enumerated power\nto strike down federal laws, let alone state ones.</p>\n<p>Nothing else in his fanciful letter -- or in <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Kozlowski/\">Ed Kozlowski</a>&#39;s perpetual nonsense\n-- is worth rebutting, except to note that Mr. Prentice has clearly not read the\nactual Mueller report.</p>\n"

I know only one poll covering Biden,\nfrom Sienna College in 2022 (overview: <a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/78\">http://link.sauyet.com/78</a>, data:\n<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/79\">http://link.sauyet.com/79</a>), ranking Biden number 19, in the top half.  Trump, by\ncontrast, is 43rd out of 45.  The other surveys covering Trump place him 41st,\n42nd, and last.  (Details below.)  While Sam Prentice sees Biden as the worst,\nexperts see him as above average and see Trump among the worst.  Evidence!</p>\n<p>I respond to Prentice&#39;s ridiculous outbursts on climate because this is today&#39;s\ndefining crisis.  I want my grandchildren to inherit a livable world.  We&#39;re on\na path away from that.  The nonsense that Heller promotes and Prentice parrots\ncould keep us from finding a better path.</p>\n",

While I would prefer &quot;resolute&quot;, &quot;adamant&quot;, or &quot;steadfast&quot;, the\nmajority -- including Democrats -- absolutely want to stop Donald Trump.  The\nreason is simple: we love our country.</p>\n<p>Our democracy began in earnest with the 1789 adoption of the Constitution,\nexpanding since in land, people, and democratic ideals.  Starting in 2017, a\ncult of personality stressed existing fractures in the foundations of our nation\nand created new ones.  Authoritarian Donald Trump convinced the gullible that\nhe, a narcissistic scion of wealth and privilege, was a man of the people who\ncould actually lead.</p>\n<p>That &quot;leadership&quot; consisted of racism, sexism, bullying, and incessant lying.\nWhere relations between groups were frayed, he tore them apart.  Where they\nseemed solid, he drove in wedges.  He began the dismemberment of our nation.\nNow he wants to finish the job.</p>\n<p>Anyone who loves this country should be fighting this tooth and nail.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kozlowski does not act like a patriot, uncritically repeating Trump&#39;s lies.\nA few responses: Mueller found incontrovertible evidence of obstruction of\njustice; I&#39;ve read the report: sitting president Trump was not indicted because\nof a long-standing Justice Department prohibition.  As with Watergate, the New\nYork indictment is about an illegal cover-up.  Trump admitted to lascivious\nbehavior; Hillary Clinton was never accused of it.  Hunter Biden is a private\ncitizen; we need care no more about his behaviors than about those of Baron\nTrump, Sasha Obama, Ron Reagan, Jr. or Amy Carter.  And anyone who disagrees\nwith helping our ally -- and major world food producer -- battle aggression from\nour long-time foe has neither compassion nor an understanding of geopolitics.</p>\n<p>Those who love our country must ceaselessly battle these lies and the\ngrandstanding politician who promulgates them!</p>\n",

He hearkens back to his high school\nrifle club.  I wonder if the coach would have approved of the widespread\nadoption of assault rifles.  What would that coach think about the fact that a\n2019 study showed that, &quot;A 10% increase in state gun ownership was associated\nwith a 35.1% higher rate of mass shootings.&quot; (<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/76\">http://link.sauyet.com/76</a>)</p>\n<p>He repeats his lie that we are not a democracy, even though it&#39;s been debunked\nalready (<a href=\"https://letters.sauyet.com/#/2020-11-20/\">https://letters.sauyet.com/#/2020-11-20/</a>.)  Again, the U.S. is both a\nrepublic (because we have no monarch) and a representative democracy (because we\nelect our lawmakers and executives.)  They&#39;re simple definitions.</p>\n<p>He also hearkens back to our founding era, quoting one of the few actively\nreligious founders, John Adams.  He claims our nuclear families and our morality\nhave slipped.  Let&#39;s look at U.S. families in 1790.  First off, nearly 20% of\nadults in this country could not marry at all.  They were bred like cattle,\ncould be raped at will by their owners, worked to death, and killed with\nimpunity.  Another 40% could be forced into marriage by their male relatives,\nwere forbidden to own property, and again, could be raped at will by their\nhusbands.  Children were forced to work at ages we would consider scandalous.</p>\n<p>If it&#39;s progressivism that has moved us from that era, then I&#39;m all for it.</p>\n<p>As to &quot;depraved perversion run amok&quot;, I&#39;d have to hear details.  I think we have\nvery different ideas about depravity.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s worth quoting another founder, Thomas Paine: &quot;I believe that religious\nduties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and in endeavoring to make our\nfellow-creatures happy.&quot;  That sounds very much like progressivism to me.</p>\n"

But they won&#39;t note that Biden has the\nbest record of job creation in history or that he has presided over a record\ndeficit reduction. Instead they&#39;ll talk about inflation, but won&#39;t acknowledge\nthat inflation is caused by external shocks (such as Russia&#39;s invasion of\nUkraine) and our booming economy.</p>\n<p>They&#39;ll talk to you about crime. They won&#39;t report that violent crime is down.\nThey&#39;ll focus on the climbing murder rate, but won&#39;t talk about the guns used in\nthose murders. Nor will they tell you that the murder rate is 40% higher in red\nstates than blue ones, that eight of the ten highest murder rates are in\nRepublican states.</p>\n<p>What they won&#39;t talk to you about is America&#39;s biggest threat: them. Their\nattempt to disenfranchise voters, to overturn an election, and to violently\nprevent Congress from doing its job is the biggest power grab imaginable.</p>\n<p>And they sure won&#39;t talk about abortion; they know you strongly disagree.</p>\n<p>They still want your vote, of course. They haven&#39;t managed to entirely destroy\nour democracy yet, so they still need it. Give them another chance at power, and\nthey could change that too. But I trust you.

They flew these people 2,100 miles from San Antonio to\nMartha&#39;s Vineyard, then disappeared. There was no housing, no jobs, no child\ncare, and no food lined up for them. The governors hadn&#39;t even warned local\nofficials about the arrival. They spent $12,300 per immigrant for this stunt,\njust on airfare.

He suggests that I don&#39;t do enough of my\nown research and am just adopting the consensus view because I am a sheep, or\nbecause sinister motivea push me to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Then he\ntells us -- incorrectly -- that water vapor absorbs on two of the bands that CO2\ndoes and therefore must dwarf the effect of the relatively small amount of CO2\nin the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Before we get to the actual facts, I really want to know Mr. Prentice, how did\nyou, a champion of independent thinking, calculate the absorption bands for CO2\nand water? What equipment did you use? What were the experimental controls? What\nwas your mathematical model? I&#39;m at least 99.9% certain that you are not a\nscientist and did not derive this information yourself. So did you get it from a\nsource you found that avoids information &quot;contrary to your biased narrative?&quot;</p>\n<p>Similarly, when you tell us that &quot;humans only produce about 4% of annual\natmospheric CO2 volumes&quot;, what do you mean to suggest? Are you saying that 4% of\ntotal atmospheric CO2 is due to human activity? Or that 4% of the annual\n<em>increase</em> is anthropogenic? And how did you calculate this? What is the\ngranularity of your test grid? Did you have to travel all over the world to\ncollect your samples? How did you collect the higher altitude ones, or did you\nuse some sort of interpolation? And in your model, how do you account for land\nuse change and decreasing water solubility at higher temparatures? What other\nfactors are in your model? Does it involve solar radiation changes, or do you\nsmooth them over?</p>\n<p>In fact, water vapor absorbs in bands around 71, 6.3, 2.7, 1.87 and 1.38\nmicrometers, where CO2 aborbs bands 15, 4.3, 2.7, and 2 micrometers. Notice that\nthere is only one overlap, not two (the bands around 1.87 and 2 are too narrow\nto overlap.) It is in the 15 and 4.3 bands that CO2 really shines. But, before\nyou ask, how do I know this, since I&#39;m not a scientist either? Well, I knew from\nprevious reading that there was an overlapping band, but like any sensible\nlayperson, I searched the web to find what they were. I did go deeper, finding a\nfew likely articles, and checking their citation counts, before settling on one\nfrom the National Library of Medicine (<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/63\">http://link.sauyet.com/63</a> - Warning: this\nis slow going and not for the mathematically faint-at-heart.) You see, I\nactually believe in the process of science, and I look to see what scientists\nhave discovered.</p>\n<p>He keeps trying to promote Tony Heller&#39;s website as a source of truth on this\nmatter... without providing evidence that there&#39;s any reason to trust Heller\nover the consensus view. But as I pointed out in June, again in July, and again\nin August, this site has been rated\n(<a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/</a>) as purely\nconspiracy-pseudoscience. Of course when he hears this, Sam Prentice turns his\nire on the fact-checkers, saying I simply seek out sympathetic positions. No. I\nmostly use four of the most trusted fact-checking sites around:\n<a href=\"https://snopes.com\">https://snopes.com</a> for urban legends, <a href=\"https://factcheck.org\">https://factcheck.org</a> and\n<a href=\"https://politifact.com/\">https://politifact.com/</a> for politics, and <a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/</a> for\nmedia analysis. These are all well-known, highly respected sites. If Mr.\nPrentice wants to suggest a different unbiased fact-checker, I&#39;m all ears.\nMeanwhile I have spent some time reading his preferred site. A response to some\nof its threads is at <a href=\"#/pages/heller-shetland/\">http://letters.sauyet.com/#/pages/heller-shetland/</a>.</p>\n<p>He discusses water vapor&#39;s greeenhouse effect. Here he&#39;s on more solid ground.\nWater vapor is a substantial source of warming. But you know why the atmosphere\nis becoming able to hold more of water vapor? Because it&#39;s being heated up by\ngases like CO2 and methane. Increasing water vapor would be spiraling out of\ncontrol if it wasn&#39;t checked. But it is, by a mechanism even Sam must have heard\nof: this little meterological process known as <em>rain</em>. There is no real\nequivalent for CO2. The natural equilibrium involving ocean, soil, and plant\nstorage of C02 is simply not able to extend to the additional amounts human\nactivity is pumping out.</p>\n<p>He claims that the attempt to reduce CO2 generation is pushing us toward\n&quot;Economic collapse, ecological calamaty, and untold human misery.&quot; Although I\ndisagree with them, I know the argument for economic collapse and hence for\nhuman misery. But how in the world will stopping the digging of fossil fuels\ncause an ecological calamity? This sounds absurd, and I&#39;d be quite curious to\nhear the justification.</p>\n<p>Finally, let&#39;s note the changing arguments of the global warming deniers.\nFifteen years ago, they claimed that the Earth was not heating up. Ten years\nago, they said, ok, it is, but human activity doesn&#39;t substantially contribute.\nNow they&#39;re accepting human causes but claiming that increasing CO2 is <em>good</em>\nfor us. It&#39;s clear they&#39;re arguing not from any evidence, but just on what will\nbest support their predecided political viewpoint.</p>\n"

    "Content": "<p><a href=\"#/person/Michael+Goodie/\">Michael Goodie</a> and <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Kozlowski/\">Ed Kozlowski</a> make similar points.  Gun laws, they say, are\nabsurd because criminals, by definition, don&#39;t follow the law.  I wonder if they\nunderstand that the same infantile tautology applies to <em>all</em> criminal law.  Do\nthey think we shouldn&#39;t have laws against rape and murder because only criminals\nwould rape and murder?  Should we have no laws regulating the handling of toxic\nchemicals because only criminals would dump those in our waterways?</p>\n<p>The argument in favor of gun control is a simple moral one.  The abundance of\nguns in our society makes us much more vulnerable.  We should reduce the number\nof guns and make people safer.</p>\n<p>Of course the Constitution specifically protects the right to bear arms.  From\n1791 to 2008 regulations limited this right in many ways.   In 2008, the Heller\ndecision claimed for the first time that this is an individual right and that\nthe &quot;well-regulated militia&quot; clause was merely prefatory, another in a series of\nbad rulings by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>One of the rationales for the right to bear arms is that citizens should be able\nto protect themselves from a tyrannical government.  If this is an individual\nright, then if my government has machine guns, I must be allowed to have them\ntoo for protection.  If they have tanks, I must be able to keep one in my\ngarage.  If they have biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, they cannot\nprevent me from stockpiling these myself.  If this sounds absurd to you,\ncongratulations, you&#39;re paying attention.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s really quite simple: if we drastically reduce the number of guns in our\nsociety, we also drastically reduce the number of harm doers who have access to\nthem.  If we do that, then we drastically reduce the threat they pose to all of\nus.</p>\n"

The film is based on the work of\nTrue the Vote, a Tea Party offshoot that specializes in challenging voter\nrights.  I have not seen the film, and I doubt Mr. Prentice had when he cited\nit, since it seems that the film wasn&#39;t even released before his letter was\npublished.  I&#39;ve seen its trailer and Charlie Kirk&#39;s fawning, hour-long\ninterview with its principals.</p>\n<p>They make interesting accusations.  Without access to their data and methodology\n(which they&#39;re releasing after the film&#39;s run) it&#39;s hard to make any substantive\njudgments about the material.  But it is clearly based on data too coarse to\nprove their main point -- cellphone ping data is not that precise.  That makes\nthe rest of it suspect, and when they start preaching about vast conspiracies\ninvolving many layers of law enforcement, the Republican Party, the Democratic\nParty, and various governors, it feels mostly like a sick joke.  I wonder if\nthey&#39;ve done the basic statistical step of measuring their results against the\nnull hypothesis.  Somehow, I doubt it.  I also wonder whether they have evidence\nto suggest any illegal votes benefited Biden over Trump.  I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>\n<p>Of course Mr. Prentice believes it.  Confirmation bias is quite powerful; when\nconspiracy theorists start spouting a new conspiracy, it will attract all sorts\nof gullible souls.  Don&#39;t be too angry with them; they mostly deserve our pity.</p>\n"

The statistics are easy to find: mass\nshooters&#39; races roughly mirror those of the population at large\n(<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/51\">http://link.sauyet.com/51</a>); the race of the perpetrators should not be an\nissue.  Let&#39;s look at his example.  We know intuitively that if the accused was\nWhite, had shot in self-defense using a licensed gun, and turned himself in to\nthe police, then Mr. Denley would be outraged that he was subject to house\narrest and a $25,000 bail when the only charge was not having a concealed carry\npermit.  Instead, he makes it an issue of race, and disparages a judge for doing\nher job, simply because of her race.</p>\n<p>Then, in a stunning instance of projection, he accuses me of fascism.  I&#39;m\ncloser to socialism.  Fascism is its opposite, and the province of the Trumpian\nfan-base, where this sort of projection has become constant.  He claims his\neconomic theory is fact and that the Biden administration must be lying about\nall the good economic numbers.  He does this without evidence... because there\nis none.  (Why didn&#39;t he think the numbers were fudged during the Trump years?)</p>\n<p>He also claims that I talk weekly about the Biden economy.  This one is easy to\ncheck.  My letters to the editor are online  (<a href=\"http://letters.sauyet.com\">http://letters.sauyet.com</a>).  I\ndouble-checked: one full letter discussed oil prices, and one sentence of\nanother rebuts Mr. Denley&#39;s nonsense on the economy.  That&#39;s it.</p>\n<p>So what was he thinking about any of this?  It&#39;s really hard to know.  But one\nthing is clear: his mouth runneth over.</p>\n"

For everyone else, it&#39;s\ngood to be armed with facts:  Presidents don&#39;t affect short-term fuel prices.\nThe oil market is international.  With a world average (March 9 data) of $4.51 a\ngallon, do they think it&#39;s to Biden&#39;s credit that we are only $4.47?</p>\n<p>These writers cannot suggest specific policies causing spikes, as there are\nnone.

 The results look like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>USA price: $4.47 per gallon\nWorld mean price (by population): $4.51 per gallon\nWorld mean price (by country): $4.90 per gallon\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can&#39;t recall where I first read that the Keystone XL Pipeline was\n(optimistically) expected to begin operations in 2023, but an article by\nLeadStories <a href=\"https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/03/fact-check-the-keystone-pipeline-was-not-just-about-completed-when-biden-stopped-it.html\">confirms this</a>.  LeadStories is a fact-checking site that is\nnew to me, but Media Bias Fact Check <a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/lead-stories/\">rates them highly</a> for accuracy and\nbeing unbiased.</p>\n<p>The chart demonstrating falling oil imports is at <a href=\"https://infogram.com/1pj5gp1pme7507u67r7k6n2kz5sm11xnnwq\">Infogram</a>, and is\nrepeated here:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://fourwindssoft.com/images/OilImports.png\"\nstyle=\"margin: 1em 5%; width: 90%\"\nalt=\"Chart of Oil Prices falling in recent years.\"/></p>\n<p>But the original source is a <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2022/03/examining-u-s-energy-independence-claims/\">FactCheck page</a>.</p>\n<p>Above I used a <code>link.sauyet.com</code> reference to that same image.  I do this so that\nsomeone looking at the newspaper article can type it more easily than trying to copy\nsomething like</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>https://infogram.com/1pj5gp1pme7507u67r7k6n2kz5sm11xnnwq</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>by hand. Even <code>bit.ly</code> urls are difficult with their mixed case identifiers.  So\nI set up something trivial at my personal site.  All it does is forward to the\nright place.  There is no tracking, nothing weird, just easier-to-type links.</p>\n<p>The information about the precipitous drop in U.S. oil consumption is from <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=49016\">The\nU.S Energy Information Administration</a> as is the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=51318\">projected record production\nnumbers</a> for 2023.</p>\n<p>Arguing that the economy is doing well is far too much for right now, and I\ndidn&#39;t cite particular facts.  But if you want some, check out the links in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/opinion/biden-economy-inflation-growth.html\">two\nrecent</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/opinion/us-economy-inflation-europe.html\">columns</a> by Paul Krugman.  Inflation is of course a major\nconcern, but inflation tends to rise with a strong economy and fall with a\nweak one, so high inflation is (tenuous) evidence as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Of course none of this addresses the elephant in the room: high oil prices\nare a drag on our personal pocketbooks and the economy in general, but if they\nhelp move us away from a carbon economy and toward renewable energy, there is\na very large silver lining.  Because any economic problems and any political\nproblems (even a land war in Europe) pale in the face of the largest problem\ncurrently facing humanity: anthropogenic climate change.</p>\n"

I found plenty of stories from last spring with many allegations and\nfact-checking refutations.  Most recent stories were from sources with no\ncredibility (IndependentSentinel.com, TownHall.com, Breitbart.com) or even the\ntinfoil hat brigade (NeedToKnow.news.)  A few months ago, there were only about\n40 incarcerated protesters still awaiting trial.</p>\n<p>Sam Prentice claimed a lack of due process.  Goldberg vs. Kelley spelled out\nwhat due processes are required in criminal cases.

His arguments about reparations are absurd, misinformed, and\ninsulting.  To debate a subject, we should actually understand what it&#39;s about.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s start with, &quot;They want white Americans to engage in self-flagellation for\nevents occurring over a century ago...&quot;  No, reparation proponents are not\nasking &quot;white Americans&quot; for anything.  They are looking for apologies and\nrecompense from institutions, not from individuals.  If Mr. Prentice chooses to\nengage in self-flagellation, it&#39;s for personal reasons.</p>\n<p>Reparations involve two things: apologizing for past behavior and atoning for\nharm.</p>\n<p>Reparations have been made in America for slavery, for stealing land from Native\nAmericans, for internment of Japanese Americans, for police brutality and\ntorture, for illegal medical experiments and forced sterilizations.  Churches,\nstates, banks, colleges, and others have provided reparations for enabling\nslavery.  Germany, Japan, Austria, and France have made reparations for WWII\natrocities.  (UMass maintains a wonderful reparations list:\n<a href=\"https://guides.library.umass.edu/reparations\">https://guides.library.umass.edu/reparations</a>).</p>\n<p>Most American reparations go to racial minorities.  This makes sense.  As a\nresult of long-standing deliberately racist policies, there remains intractable\nracial discrimination in housing, the criminal justice system, college\nadmissions, and elsewhere.  Systemic racial biases demonstrate the enormous\nshadow of slavery, our country&#39;s original sin.  Reparations could be one small\npartial fix for the problem.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice&#39;s focus on the Democratic party&#39;s history is tedious.  Yes, it\nshould apologize for connections to slavery; I don&#39;t know if it ever has.\nIgnore his lies about Chicago; I doubt even he believes them.  But we should\nnote the absurdity of his claiming Democrats interned the Japanese.  It was the\nU.S. government; the President&#39;s party is irrelevant.</p>\n<p>As usual, Mr. Prentice ignores facts and makes absurd conclusions.  Perhaps he&#39;s\nthe exception that proves my rule.</p>\n"

Even morons spouting drivel must be tolerated.  In\ndialog and mutual critique we discover truth.</p>\n<p>How does this apply to <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Kozlowski/\">Ed Kozlowski</a>&#39;s latest bogeyman, Neil Young?  Isn&#39;t his\nSpotify ultimatum -- Joe Rogan or Young -- an unacceptable deplatforming?  Well\nno.  When Twitter suspended Trump&#39;s account for violating its terms, fans quit\nTwitter in protest.  They were perfectly justified.  The same holds for Neil\nYoung.  If a platform offends you, whether by suspending your hero&#39;s access or\nby hosting Covid misinformation promoters, then you can withhold your approval,\nyour attention, or your music catalog.  It doesn&#39;t repudiate the marketplace of\nideas; it&#39;s how that marketplace functions.  Personally, I&#39;m with Jill\nFilipovic, who said Spotify &quot;should draw the line at dangerous life-threatening\nconspiracy theories.&quot;</p>\n<p>Mr. Kozlowski&#39;s remaining letter is a monstrous waste.  First he paints the\nReaganite Neil Young as a hero of Progressivism, then bashes Young for an old\nhomophobic statement, and parrots bits of a ridiculous conspiracy theory\ninvolving Young selling music rights to Hipgnosis (great name!), Blackstone&#39;s\nlater investment, their hiring a former Pfizer executive, suppression of\nanti-vaxx information, and, likely, Elvis and space aliens. Such idiocy is\nincreasingly the enterprise of the right.</p>\n<p>...I just read Jonathan Rauch&#39;s <em>The Constitution of Knowledge</em>, which discusses\nhow we determine truth: in science, in economics, in politics.  He breaks little\nnew ground, but it&#39;s a wonderful synthesis of ideas from Hobbes to Locke and\nMadison, to Trumpian disinformation and modern cancel culture.  The marketplace\nof ideas is a central concern.  I highly recommend it.</p>\n"

You found no sign of railing about anything, perhaps?  No critique of\nmeritocracy?  Don&#39;t be surprised.

For non-White students, that number is no more than 16%.  Many\ndoors are opened by degrees from a prestigious university, so this is one more\nexample of how structural racism perpetuates racial inequality.  The world is\nfull of such examples.  Noting and reporting them is not racism.  Denying them\noften is.</p>\n<p>Finally, we should note the odd obsession of Sam Prentice and other\nconservatives with the Democratic party.  Sixty-plus years ago, the parties\nswapped places in their approach to race; today the vast majority of\nAfrican-Americans find the Democratic party the more congenial home.

    "Content": "<p>Two things.</p>\n<p>First, I was surprised to agree with a recent letter from <a href=\"#/person/Gary+Gile/\">Gary Gile</a>. He had\ndescribed some serious concerns and presented actual facts. Last week he\nreturned to true form and shared a laundry list of falsehoods and\nconspiracy-minded nonsense.</p>\n<p>He structured his complaints as a review of the first months of President\nBiden&#39;s term, but talked about trends continuing from the previous\nadministration: think murder rate, illegal immigration, gas prices, and\nespecially the Covid pandemic. (More details at FactCheck:\n<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/29\">http://link.sauyet.com/29</a>.)</p>\n<p>Most egregious was his Covid take. First, &quot;so-called pandemic&quot;? How can he\nsuggest this has been anything but a pandemic with over 219 million cases\nworldwide and 4.5 million deaths? He makes some crack about the recent flu\nseason. It was far lower than normal for the simple and obvious reason that the\nflu is transmitted by the same mechanisms as Covid so all the Covid-prevention\nmeasures helped prevent the flu.</p>\n<p>Worst, though was his claim that Covid is no more deadly than the yearly flu.\nHow can you credit anything said by someone claiming such obvious balderdash? An\naverage flu season in the US claims around 36,000 lives. Covid in the last\neighteen months has claimed over 660,000. It seems to have an infection fatality\nrate ten to twenty times greater than the flu. These are not hard facts to find.</p>\n<p>Second, <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Smith/\">Edmund Smith</a> overstates his case regarding the origins of Christian\nbeliefs. Certainly, scholars can find antecedents for nearly every facet of the\nreligion. A few, like Christmas/Saturnalia and the English name for Easter are\nwell documented. The rest is at best well-grounded speculation. For someone who\nchides people for not understanding science and its methods, his letters are a\nlittle too cavalier in their confident historical claims about ancient events\nwithout any contemporaneous documentation.</p>\n"

Great\nswaths of supposedly independent voices are also controlled by a tiny cadre of\nthe wealthy. It&#39;s long past time we reverse the media deregulation enacted under\nReagan and Clinton.</p>\n<p>In our main topic, <a href=\"#/person/Peter+Kushkowski/\">Peter Kushkowski</a> uses the misleading phrase: &quot;atheistic\nscience&quot;. Science does not take a stand on theism versus atheism. Science is\nabout statements we could prove false; it&#39;s impossible to falsify anything said\nabout omnipotent beings who might wish to hide their tracks... although Occam&#39;s\nRazor does apply.</p>\n<p>Science covers theories and the evidence to support them. Buddhists, Christians,\nHindus, Muslims, and others don&#39;t generally try to present evidence for their\nbeliefs. Nor do they often attempt to convince others of their own beliefs. When\nthey do it&#39;s usually circular reasoning (God is great because it says so in\nscripture, and the scripture is right because it&#39;s the word of God) or sophism\nlike Pascal&#39;s Wager or the First Cause, nonsense scientists feel little need to\nrebut.</p>\n<p>The issues theists discuss overlap little with those of science.

These\ndays &quot;mainstream media&quot; connotes &quot;journalism that doesn&#39;t agree with my\npreconceived conservative ideas&quot;.</p>\n<p>People using &quot;mainstream media&quot; imply they have access to highly credible,\nwell-hidden sources the rest of us have overlooked. That&#39;s almost never true.\nInstead it means that because they don&#39;t like the facts, they will proclaim\nfalsehoods that suit them better. Think global warming deniers. Think\nanti-vaxxers.</p>\n<p>You see this everywhere. A recent letter was a good example, suggesting that\nPonzi-schemer Martin Armstrong was locked up not for fraud and not because he\nwouldn&#39;t return his ill-gotten gains, but because he wanted to keep his source\ncode private. I&#39;m sure the writer would tell you that the mainstream media got\nall this wrong. Hint: you can believe the normal press, court filings, and many\nrebuttal websites over Armstrong&#39;s own pages.</p>\n",

(The best study is also from Pew: <a href=\"https://pewrsr.ch/2UxYt7F\">https://pewrsr.ch/2UxYt7F</a>.)</p>\n<p>I recognize that not all conservatives feel this way; it&#39;s mostly those\npromoting the virtue of selfishness: the Randians and the libertarian right.\nThose who believe that government should only maintain a military, police force,\nand court system tend toward suspicion of government efforts in public health\n(or education, environmental protection, etc.) This strand of conservatism\nobjects to masks and social distancing rules.</p>\n<p>But clearly this does not include all conservatives. I will try to be more\ncareful about such sweeping generalizations. I am battling ideas, not\nindividuals, and I absolutely got this wrong. Again, I apologize to Ms. Conrad\nand to all other goodhearted conservatives I insulted.</p>\n"

    "Content": "<p>The coronavirus crisis demonstrates one difference between conservatism and\nliberalism. Conservatism promotes competition and the virtue of selfishness. It\nargues that freedom arises when individuals compete in literal and philosophical\nmarketplaces for selfish goals. Modern liberalism says there is also benefit in\ncooperation. It notes that governments and other institutions arise as\ncooperative associations for mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>Who resists wearing a face mask?</p>\n<p>Conservatives, of course. &quot;Wearing a mask does not protect me from the virus.\nWhy should I erode my freedom, consenting to this tyrannical and uncomfortable\nfashion accessory?&quot; (That these same people insist that bulletproof backpacks,\narmed school guards, and live-shooter drills are just the price of freedom is a\nfuture discussion.)</p>\n<p>They&#39;re correct. Face masks do little to protect wearers. Liberals agree; why\ndon&#39;t they also object? Simple: liberals understand we are part of a society.\nGroup well-being sometimes trumps personal choices. Wearing a mask does not\nprotect me; it protects those around me. Having others wear masks protects me.</p>\n<p>&quot;But,&quot; sputter the conservatives, &quot;didn&#39;t Benjamin Franklin say, &#39;Those who\nwould give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve\nneither Liberty nor Safety?&#39;&quot; Yes. He also said, &quot;We must, indeed, all hang\ntogether or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.&quot; Wearing a mask to\nreduce the spread of a pandemic is not a major infringement on liberty. It&#39;s a\ncollective solution to a shared problem.</p>\n<p>For centuries, philosophers debated how altruism might arise in a society of\nself-interest. In the 1980s, social scientists found the answer. Robert\nAxelrod&#39;s The Evolution of Cooperation demonstrates mathematically that a small\ncollection of cooperating individuals can out-compete their more selfish\nbrethren. Liberals&#39; notion of community action even at some loss to oneself is\nevolutionarily sound.</p>\n<p>So wear your masks.  By benefiting your community, you also benefit yourself.</p>\n"

I just read\nOreskes and Conway&#39;s <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>, and I highly recommend it (or the\ndocumentary based on it.) It describes how since the 1950s there has been a\ncoordinated effort to discredit inconvenient science, how an overlapping cast of\ncharacters has been involved in denying that tobacco causes lung cancer, that\nReagan&#39;s Star Wars idea was infeasible, that power company emissions cause acid\nrain, that CFCs cause the ozone hole, that second-hand smoke is dangerous, and\nthat burning fossil fuels causes global warming.</p>\n<p>This process started with the tobacco companies. Because they had no reasonable\nway to attack the science heads-on, they formed an array of pseudo-independent\norganizations meant only to sow doubt about the science. They managed to\nconvince journalists to cover this as though there was actual scientific\ncontroversy. They kept this up forty years, selling many more cigarettes along\nthe way.</p>\n<p>This worked so well that although scientists made it clear that Reagan&#39;s Star\nWars wasn&#39;t possible, a small group used the tobacco play-book to attack the\nscience detailing nuclear winter. The same people then promoted acid rain\ndenial, ozone obfuscation, and the current project of denying global warming.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, the science is clear. But former cold warriors like Fred\nSinger, Robert Jastrow, Fred Leitz, and Bill Nierenberg made a career of\nmuddying the waters, trying to make us believe the answers are not\nwell-established. They found gullible journalists and bystanders to promote\ntheir fantasies. The book makes a credible case that the motivation of such\nonce-prominent scientists is that they believe they&#39;re still fighting Communism,\nthat regulations yield a slippery slope towards socialism.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s well worth a read.</p>\n"

But he&#39;s not a football coach; we cannot assume his\nexpertise transfers.   Dr. Giaever is a Nobel-prize winning physicist; we should\nlisten respectfully to his scientific comments.  But a retired professor of\nphysics is not a likely contributor to climatology.  Moreover, his affiliation\nwith the anti-science Heartland Institute makes his pronouncements questionable.\nThis think tank plainly lets ideology and funding drive its science, rejecting\nthe tobacco/cancer link and fighting the global warming consensus.  Listen\npolitely to Dr. Giaever, but don&#39;t count on his understanding or objectivity.</p>\n<p>This goes double for mathematician David Evans and retired chemist Les Woodcock.</p>\n<p>(Next week: more scientists.)</p>\n"

    "Content": "<p><a href=\"#/person/Dan+Armstrong/\">Dan Armstrong</a> argues that the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate\nchange is exaggerated, listing academics who challenge that consensus. I planned\na parody letter, listing professors rejecting evolution or promoting flat-earth\ntheories. It could have been amusing. But instead, over a few letters I will\ndiscuss the scientists Mr. Armstrong has presented. First, a few words about\nscience.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong says, &quot;Predicting future events based on past events is not\nexperimentally proven science; it is statistical forecasting.&quot; No, creating\nprediction models is exactly what science does, combining past events and\ntheoretical understanding in varying proportions. For sciences like Newtonian\nmechanics we create experiments; others, like cosmology, are much harder to\nverify experimentally. Always, though, science is about creating predictive and\nresilient models.</p>\n<p>Noting that weather models are inherently complex and accurate over only short\nterms, Mr. Armstrong asks how much more complex climate models must be: how\ncould we know they&#39;re accurate? Well, models of larger phenomena smooth the\nsmaller systems. With non-linear feedback and turbulence, fluid dynamics is\nextremely complex. Predicting the waves would be impossible, right? Yet we have\nprecise and accurate tide charts far in advance. It&#39;s similar with climate and\nweather. Climate is driven by different inputs than weather; many trends can be\nmodeled. It&#39;s not easy; climate models are certainly complex. But it&#39;s not the\nimpossible task Dan Armstrong claims.</p>\n<p>Another letter suggests there&#39;s no true consensus because many scientists and\nscholars disagree. This is incorrect; there is a very strong consensus. That\ndoes not imply unanimity, but by most counts at least 97% of climate scientists\nagree that global temperature is rapidly rising, that humans are a substantial\ncause. Of 54,195 peer-reviewed papers studied between 1991 and 2015, only five\nrejected the consensus. And the agreement increases with climate expertise.

Here are some of the\nthings happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Today&#39;s youth are leading the charge against global warming.

Growth per\ncapita is similar, as is growth across most industries. The economy was in\nrecession an average of 1.1 quarters during Democratic terms and 4.6 quarters\nduring Republican ones.</p>\n<p>Employment growth under Democrats averaged 2.59% and under Republicans, 1.17%.\nThe unemployment rate for the Democrats averaged 5.64% and for the Republicans\n6.01%. (This was not statistically significant.)</p>\n<p>The S &amp; P 500 Index grew at an annual 2.70% rate under the GOP and at 8.08% when\na Democrat was in the White House.  Corporate profits grew 5.62% during\nDemocratic administrations and 4.74% during Republican ones.</p>\n<p>Worker hourly productivity grew 2.55% and compensation at 1.81% during\nDemocratic years, but by 2.08% and 1.43%, respectively. during Republican ones.\nBudget deficit averaged 1.5% of GDP for Democrats and 2.2% for Republicans.</p>\n<p>The inflation rate was 2.97% for Democrats and 3.2% for Republicans; it rose an\naverage of 1.05 percentage points over a Democratic term and fell an average of\n0.83 points during a Republican one.  This is less hopeful to Republicans than\nit sounds, though, since rising inflation is a sign of high growth, falling\ninflation of low growth.</p>\n<p>There is little to explain these facts.  My point is not that Democratic\npresidents are much better for the economy than are Republicans.  I actually\nbelieve the president has little to do with year-to-year economic performance.\nBut some seem to think that Republican are much better for the economy.  They\nare wrong, pure and simple.</p>\n"

(Congrats to\nBuchanan and Harding for making it out of the cellar!) The reasons are evident.\nHe sows discord and hatred, he belittles and bullies, he lies incessantly.  He\ngets his information from right-wing broadcasters, but calls the media the enemy\nof the people.  He denigrates allies and praises dictators.  He fashions trade\nwars because of economic illiteracy.</p>\n<p>His inept administration has seen unprecedented turnover. Investigations into\nRussian interference have generated 33 indictments and won convictions of three\nsenior Trump associates.</p>\n<p>The only positive is the booming economy (although signs point to a slow-down.)\nWhat credit can Mr. Trump claim?  10-year charts of stock prices, unemployment,\nor total jobs make obvious that these numbers merely continue trends from the\nearly Obama years.  For instance, under Trump the Dow Jones has seen an average\nannual gain of 11.63%, quite good for a Republican -- who had only averaged\n3.52% since Nixon -- but in line with the Democratic average of 11.0%, and below\nboth Obama&#39;s and Clinton&#39;s numbers.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s it.  There is nothing else good to say.  He follows Obama&#39;s unfortunate\npractice of governing through executive orders, and is clobbered in the courts\nover it.  His only substantive legislation was the Tax Scam bill -- not\nsomething to brag about.</p>\n<p>Now, ignoring the actual crisis -- climate change -- Mr. Trump shut down the\ngovernment over a manufactured one.  Trump didn&#39;t try funding his wall for two\nyears, but now it&#39;s an emergency?  After proclaiming he would take\nresponsibility for a shutdown, he&#39;s blaming Congressional Democrats?</p>\n<p>This is not the behavior of a sane, competent leader.

The first (Jardim, et. al.,\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo\">http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo</a>), using new methodologies which are credible but not yet\nwidely recognized, found some negative employment effects in Seattle from the\nongoing minimum wage hikes.  The second (Allegretto et. al.,\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FarW0l\">http://bit.ly/2FarW0l</a>) examined six large cities, including Seattle and San\nFrancisco, using more widely accepted methodologies and found no such effects.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy is common in social sciences research.  Usually, outlier\nstudies will not be replicated.  Occasionally, they reveal insights that change\nthe theory.  For now the bulk of the research, starting with a 1994 study by\nCard and Krueger (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf\">http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf</a>), confirms that minimum wage hikes do\nexactly what they&#39;re intended to do: increase income for the poorest workers\nwhile barely changing employment and inflation.</p>\n<p>If Mr. Prentice wants to dispute this, his theory is not enough.  He really\nneeds to provide evidence.</p>\n<p>On another topic, I apologize if I suggested that Mr. Prentice is more widely\nread than he is.  The philosophy he expounds sounds so much like Ayn Rand&#39;s that\nI assumed he had read her works.  I can&#39;t really recommend them; her writing is\nfar too didactic to make for readable novels.

So we&#39;ll return to our old\nstandby: refuting the Randian.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve suggested that if you want to know how liberals think, you should ask one.\nThe same goes for Democrats. <a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice/\">Sam Prentice</a> knows little about either.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#39;t read Ayn Rand&#39;s fantasies, you might not recognize their\ninfluence on Mr. Prentice.  His latest missive seem rooted in the idea that\nEllsworth Toohey, an over-the-top caricature of a false friend, from Rand&#39;s The\nFountainhead, is the heart of every Democrat. It suggests that Wesley Mouch from\nAtlas Shrugged, an envious, incompetent buffoon with too much power, is their\nbrain.</p>\n<p>Sam Prentice really should remember that these are works of fantasy. Most\nthinking folks get over sophomoric fascinations with Ayn Rand by age 25.  It&#39;s\nunseemly in someone older.</p>\n<p>Democrats do not promote equality of outcomes.  However, they are likely to\npromote equality of opportunity, with policies designed to reduce structural\ninequalities, especially regarding children. Lately, Republicans are the\nopposite.  See the tax bill, which barely helps most people, and then only\ntemporarily, but gives large permanent cuts to the wealthy and corporations.</p>\n<p>Finally we come to the minimum wage.  Mr. Prentice repeats his 2015 assertions\nabout minimum wage hikes.  He provides no evidence because he cannot.  The best\nstudy of these issues was  done by Dube, Lester, and Reich in 2010\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA\">http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA</a>).  An easier-to-read summary was by John Schmitt in 2013\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1eWItVi\">http://bit.ly/1eWItVi</a>). The results are conclusive: there is, &quot;no statistically\nsignificant negative employment effects of the minimum wage.&quot;  Nor did minimum\nwage hikes substantially change wages higher up the pay scale.</p>\n<p>Looking at the world through Rand-colored glasses is pure fantasy.</p>\n"

A regulation-free economy would\nallow the unscrupulous to provide slaves. It would allow child labor.  It would\nallow lead paint in children&#39;s toys.  It could not demand truthful advertising\nor require accurate ingredient labels. To say that we would fix these flaws by\nlaw is already to distort free markets.</p>\n<p>Free markets provide many goods and services, but there are many others they\ncannot provide.  How about public goods, such as courts, the military,\nfirefighters, police, roads?  There is no incentive for an individual to pay for\nthem, so there is no incentive for someone to sell them.  Do free-market\nworshipers think we should just do without them?</p>\n<p>And what about when economic exchanges adversely affects someone other than the\nparticipants, known as &quot;negative externalities&quot;?  A free market offers little\nways to prevent industrial pollution, to inhibit overfishing, to avoid\nantibiotic resistant pathogens.</p>\n<p>Free markets also face power imbalances.  How bad would cell service be and how\nhigh would prices be in five years if Verizon bought all its major competitors\ntoday?  When the trust-busters broke up Standard Oil or AT&amp;T, they were helping\nconsumers, who had no power of their own.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest problem in free markets is that they recognize only the\nvalue of money.  If something does not have a price, it is not considered\nvaluable.  Things such as ethical standards have no price-point, so the free\nmarkets reject them.  Uninhibited free markets can have a corrosive effect on\nour entire society.</p>\n"

That&#39;s fair; I think his is pure sophistry,\nspinning facts to fit a ridiculous narrative.</p>\n<p>Spin: I described the Republican Party&#39;s degradation into serving the\nultra-rich, Mr. Devin&#39;s response? Discussing the money given to Democrats. He\nquotes a study (based on opensecrets.org data) cherry-picking information to\nmake it look like labor unions donate as much as corporations.</p>\n<p>Fact: OpenSecrets contradicts this (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/biz-labor\">http://bit.ly/biz-labor</a>): &quot;Whatever slice\nyou look at, business interests dominate, with an overall advantage over\norganized labor of about 15-to-1.&quot; Mr. Devin ignores my main point, that the\nnational Republican party is laser-focused on policies benefitting only their\nmegarich donors.</p>\n<p>Spin: Responding to my lament about Republican deference to the gun lobby, Dan\nDevin notes how little the NRA donates to Federal candidates.</p>\n<p>Fact: The NRA&#39;s political spends mostly on member communications and political\nads: fifty times as much on political ads as on donations. It focuses on the\nstates. Moreover, the NRA is only a part of the gun lobby. Again, this misses\nthe main point: even with astounding gun violence and massive support for\nchange, Republican lawmakers vote in lock-step with the gun lobby.</p>\n<p>Spin: I&#39;d pointed out that we had an impeachment centered on &quot;the sexual conduct\nof [Bill Clinton].&quot; Mr. Devin responds with legalisms about the articles of\nimpeachment claiming perjury and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>Fact: The charges came\nfrom an investigation into a land deal in Arkansas, turned to the firing of\nWhite House travel agents, then turned to alleged misuse of FBI files before\nturning to President Clinton&#39;s affair with an intern. This was clearly an\nattempt to find some charge. Those articles didn&#39;t mention anything salacious,\nbut his sexual misconduct underlaid them. The Trump impeachment will also use\nwords like &quot;perjury&quot; and &quot;obstruction&quot;, but it will actually be based on\n&quot;incompetence&quot;, &quot;abusiveness&quot;, &quot;perfidy&quot;, perhaps even &quot;treason&quot;.</p>\n"

Now, they stand only for the financial interests of\ntheir billionaire sponsors.  They stand for Adelson, Mercer, Koch, et. al.</p>\n<p>Remember the deficit hawks?  In 2009, and throughout the Obama years, the\nRepublican party screamed that we couldn&#39;t afford any spending because of the\ndeficit?  When the economy needed additional stimulus, Republicans nixed it for\ndeficit reasons, causing years of unnecessarily slow growth.  Today they balloon\nthe deficit with a TaxScam bill for the wealthy and corporations, selling it\nwith small temporary cuts for working folks.  Then they pass a budget that adds\ntrillions to the debt.  This is plain hypocrisy.</p>\n<p>Remember Republican outrage over the sexual conduct of a President? Wasn&#39;t there\nan impeachment centered on that?  Now they support Roy Moore, Donald Trump, etc.\nAny moral authority they ever claimed? Destroyed.</p>\n<p>Remember support for the rule of law?  The tough-on-crime party now supports a\nPresident who publicly admits to obstruction of justice. They publish misleading\nreports and suppress important responses.  As kids are being killed, they kowtow\nto the gun lobby.  They&#39;ve  become the lawless-and-disordered party.</p>\n<p>Remember when the United States was an international leader?

That\nBreitbart and Trump said otherwise should not be confused with evidence.\nAfrican American unemployment is quite low; little credit is due Donald Trump.\nIt fell 8.6 percentage points in the preceding five years, and 1.2 points last\nyear -- all before Donald Trump&#39;s first budget.

Congress created the CFPB and gave it a long leash, but they can alter\nor abolish it.  It&#39;s subject to GAO audit, Congressional oversight, and Senate\nconfirmations.

Instead, I blamed him for abandoning the best\nattempt to address it and forsaking America&#39;s leadership on the issue.</p>\n<p>Mr. Carli describes the thermal relationship between Earth and Sun and\nhistorical variations of temperature. Outside mistaking glaciers for galaxies\n<del>and confusing an isotope of carbon with a temperature (huh?)</del>\n(<strong>Note</strong>: <em>that last phrase was removed in the published version -- the editor\nexplained that it involved his own misreading of Mr. Carli&#39;s hand-written\nletter</em>), his facts seem solid. But they&#39;re entirely irrelevant. The warming\nscientists describe relates to a reduction of the energy reflected to space, not\nthe heat from burning carbon. The portion returned to space has been decreasing\nbecause our atmosphere absorbs more energy.</p>\n<p>The strong scientific consensus is that this is caused by human-generated gasses\nin the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. Mr. Carli presents no disputes to\nthis and he brings up irrelevancies. He discusses mathematical proof. Absurd:\nscience is never about that. And he mentions a temperature drop from January,\n2014 to February, 2014 as though that were evidence against global warming. It&#39;s\neasy to see how tiny an anomaly this is at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps\">http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps</a>.</p>\n<p>In short, humans are causing our land, oceans, and atmosphere to heat rapidly.\nThere is no scientific controversy over this. Yet fossil-fuel industry funded\nresearchers muddy the waters. Conservatives, threatened by changes to their\nbusiness models, buy into such crackpot theories.</p>\n<p>Previously, when we&#39;ve had ecological problems, people came together to address\nthem.  Note that litter has decreased in this generation. Note that toxic\nwaterways have been cleaned.  Note that we hear little now about acid rain or\nthe ozone hole.  We came together to solve such problems.  But these days, with\npersonalized news feeds creating echo chambers, we get people accepting\nridiculous lies and denying the truth.</p>\n<p>Cloaking oneself in irrelevancies is still a form of lying.</p>\n"

Why is\nthat any more relevant than the fact that &quot;Don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; was announced\nthat same day?  He quotes testimony from Andrew McCabe, who would not\nnecessarily have any reason to know about his boss&#39; request, as though that\ndisproves all the other reports about Comey&#39;s resource request.

The House ran into\nconstituent opposition; the Senate avoids this by keeping the public in the\ndark. Complaining bitterly about how Democrats passed Obamacare, Republicans\nretreat on transparency and honesty.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple: they don&#39;t know how to govern. Republicans win by being\nallergic to specifics. They campaign on Small-Government slogans that resonate\nwith voters. But whenever they convert these slogans into policy, the public\nbalks.  However symbolically conservative voters might be, they are\noperationally liberal: they like specific programs government provides.</p>\n<p>This disconnect between abstract belief and specific support precipitates\nabsurdities like, &quot;Keep your government hands off my Medicare!&quot; and &quot;We have to\nrepeal Obamacare, but keep the ACA!&quot; This is the logical outcome of Republicans&#39;\npenchant for simplistic answers to complex problems.

Instead,\nthey&#39;re removing Democrats from the process, crafting a bill that can&#39;t pass\nwithout Democrats, and preparing to blame Democrats for its failure.

We elect a slate of\nelectors who choose the president.  They can choose anyone. The number of\nelectors varies unevenly: a Vermont voter has 2.4 times the influence of a\nConnecticut voter.  If the electors cannot reach a majority decision, the\nelection goes to the House, which must choose one of the top three electoral\ncandidates.  Here there&#39;s just one vote per state. State delegations must\nthemselves first agree; if they can&#39;t, they get no vote.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice thinks this system is simpler than the one-person, one-vote of the\nNPV.  Really?</p>\n<p>Alexander Hamilton argued that the Electoral College would assure the Presidency\nwas not granted to &quot;any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the\nrequisite qualifications.&quot;  And it would stymie &quot;the desire in foreign powers to\ngain an improper ascendant in our councils.&quot;  The recent election showcased the\nElectoral College failing at this.

A propagandist filmmaker, heir to\nNazi favorite Leni Riefenstahl, inspires little confidence. What would the Right\nthink of a President putting Michael Moore in a position of influence?</p>\n<p>Worse is Steve Bannon&#39;s turn at the helm of Breitbart News. Breitbart was never\nloved by the Left but once Mr. Bannon took charge it became a cesspool of\noffensiveness. The alt-right simply rebrands ideas we&#39;d hoped were outgrown:\nvirulent anti-Semitism, brutal racism, nasty misogyny, and a xenophobic\nanti-immigrant stance at odds with American history and values. While it&#39;s\ndifficult to discern Mr. Bannon&#39;s personal feelings on these issues, the culture\nhe fostered is simply barbarous.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice challenges the Left&#39;s rejection of Mr. Bannon and Donald Trump as\nhypocritical. He suggests we&#39;re ignoring our own emphasis on universally\nincreasing prosperity. First, it&#39;s been impossible to discern actual policy\npositions from the Trump campaign or its aftermath.. More importantly, when you\nchoose with whom you will ally, you must choose holistically, not on a\nparticular stance. Perhaps the jury is still out on Mr. Bannon, and perhaps not,\nbut the entire campaign of hatred has shown Donald Trump to be someone with whom\nthe Left has too little in common.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is offensive in the extreme, the greatest danger to our Republic\nsince the Civil War.

Remember, there are no\nConstitutional bounds on the decision of the college. They can decide to vote\nwith the majority for the most qualified candidate in a generation. Amidst all\nthis talk of transition plans and offensive appointees, the actual presidential\nvote happens December 19. There could still be surprises this election!</p>\n<p>How do such folks promote the electoral majority? One letter starts &quot;The\nAmerican people have spoken, and very loudly!&quot; That&#39;s amusing because the people\nactually preferred Clinton by 1.5+ million votes, and a switch of 90,000 votes\nin the right places would have given her the electoral win as well. Another\ntalks about how the electoral college protects the interests of small states\nover the large ones. I have several responses to this. First, I prefer to\nprotect the interests of voters than of states. Second, when we hear talk about\nstates rights, it always seems to be about suppressing rights of minorities.\nFinally, it&#39;s simply unfair and undemocratic that a voter in Wyoming gets 2.97\nelectoral votes for each one a voter in Connecticut gets.</p>\n<p>As to concerns about recent protests, please understand that when the biggest\nbully in the county becomes sheriff, his victims get justifiably scared. Trump\nran a campaign of hatred, lies, and intimidation. We&#39;re already seeing huge\nincreases in hate crimes. People are scared. They probably should be.</p>\n<p>But don&#39;t worry.

Personally, I&#39;m glad to\nlisten to those who actually know what they&#39;re talking about. Unfortunately,\nthat does not include Mr. Prentice.</p>\n<p>He reaches the exact same wrong conclusions as early reports on right-wing\nmedia, conclusions already discredited by professional fact-checkers and charity\nwatchers. (And his is independent research?) Applying his techniques to the 990\nfilings from Amnesty International, Oxfam, and the Red Cross, would show that\nthese also must be horrible frauds, awarding grants totaling only 25.7%, 29.5%\nand 3.98% of their budgets, respectively. This should help demonstrate that his\nmethods are wrong.</p>\n<p>The trouble, as Mr. Prentice has already been informed, is that the Clinton\nFoundation is more like these organizations, running its own programs, not\nmaking grants like the Carnegie Foundation. So, on that 990 form, line 10, he\nneeds to divide line 25(B) by line 25(A) to determine the portion of the\nfoundation&#39;s spending that went to charitable work. 25(C) and 25(D) represent\nmanagement overhead and fund-raising. Note that Charity Navigator and Charity\nWatch give the Clinton Foundation top marks.</p>\n<p>The bigger issue is that Sam Prentice and his peers can stick to such balderdash\nin the face of the clear evidence that it&#39;s fallacious. Something has gone quite\nwrong when people let their ideology overshadow the truth. This is not limited\nto the right-wing, but it seems much more prominent there, starting with the\nlikes of Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich, and leading eventually to the most\npreposterous candidate for president any major party has ever nominated.</p>\n"

He has a reasonable explanation of why he thinks so. But he\npresents no evidence.</p>\n<p>There is a good reason for this. The evidence all contradicts his theory. The\nbest study of these issues was done by Dube, Lester, and Reich in 2010\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA\">http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA</a>). This is a technical paper and not particularly easy to\nread, but anyone who&#39;s taken a statistics course and is not afraid of Greek\nletters should be able to follow it.

(Unlike certain other\nletter-writers who do seem to believe that repeating their idiotic insults will\nmake them true.) Mr. Prentice exhorts us to &quot;return to the spirit of the\nConstitution&quot;. Let&#39;s try to see what that might mean.</p>\n<p>The American revolutionaries won their independence and put in place a small,\nweak government. They were not happy with it. They wrote the Constitution\nexpressly to give the national government more power. Anyone who wants to wrap\nhimself in both the spirit of the Constitution and the notion of a small\ngovernment must come to terms with that contradiction.</p>\n<p>But the Founders were afraid of investing too much power in any individual or\ninstitution. That sounds a lot like what I described for progressivism.\nProgressives worry about the concentration of power in the hands of the rich, of\nthe government, of corporations. The Constitution dealt with this concern in an\nintricate series of checks on each branch of government, on the federal\ngovernment as a whole, on the states, and even on the popular will of its\ncitizens.</p>\n<p>Returning to the spirit of the Constitution involves ensuring that no\nindividuals or institutions amass enough power to threaten the rest of us. Or\nthat at the very least there are counterbalancing institutions to keep them in\ncheck.</p>\n<p>Please remember that those who fought for independence, wrote the Declaration,\nwrote the Constitution, and served as our first generation of leaders were the\nprogressives of their day. To support the spirit of their document is to support\nthe spirit of progressivism.</p>\n"

Corporations are constructs made of laws and\ncontracts. They exist by public sufferance and should only be tolerated if on\nbalance they improve the public interest. Liberals recognize that corporations\nhave a lot of good to offer, but will not accept the ridiculous notion that\nregulations are inherently anti-business, anti-American.

This involves\ndemonstrating the absurdity of his conclusions even had his assumptions been\ncorrect. Mr. Corso points out that on the day President Obama took office the\nfederal debt stood at $10.6 trillion, meaning that all the previous presidents\ncombined had racked up a total debt of $10.6 trillion. Then he points out that\nsince then almost $8 trillion dollars has been added, which he claims is, &quot;more\nthan all other presidents combined!&quot; So Chuck Corso says that &quot;almost $8\ntrillion&quot; is more than $10.6 trillion. And he wonders why people don&#39;t take him\nseriously on other matters?</p>\n<p>You see how easy that was?

What they did best was to build\na living document, designed to change with the times. Madison&#39;s optimism that\npeople could adapt his Constitutional framework to the needs of their times\nproved true. Jefferson&#39;s pessimism that each generation would need its own\nrevolution proved false.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice, progressives do not believe in a controlling central authority. We\nbelieve government is the banding together of its people to prevent the abuse of\nthe weak by the strong, ensuring that all get a fair shot at life, liberty and\nthe pursuit of happiness. Progressives want the government to prevent the rich\nand powerful from rigging the system so they and their children have the best of\neverything. We want the American dream available to all.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you want to know how scientists think, ask them instead of Sam\nPrentice. If there are none handy, you can ask schoolchildren about the\nscientific method. They will explain that science isn&#39;t the search for Truth;\nthat&#39;s left for theologians.</p>\n<p>Scientists create theories about the natural world and make observations and\nexperiments that attempt to disprove them. The longer a theory withstands such\nattempts, the more credible it becomes. Eventually a theory becomes established\nas the consensus of the scientific community. That is the current state of the\ntheory that human activity is responsible for global warming. Tellingly, Mr.\nPrentice only sees or only believes studies that support his ideology. He needs\nto learn something from those schoolchildren.</p>\n"

Let&#39;s be\nreasonable, and suggest annual salary, including benefits of $60,000 per guard.\nOh, and perhaps we should consider movie theaters too, and a few other venues,\nwherever people might be vulnerable to a nutjob with an Uzi.

Deregulation frenzy started\nunder Reagan, lasting twenty-eight years. The Glass-Steagall act was repealed\nunder Clinton. Dodd contributed. Even Goldwater gets blame -- for starting the\nmovement.</p>\n<p>Corso compares the 7.8% 2009 unemployment rate with today&#39;s 8.1%. Should we\nblame Reagan for the increase from 7.5% to 10.8% in October, 1982? How about\nBush Sr., who oversaw it rise from 5.4% to 7.3%? Bush Jr. inherited 4.2% from\nClinton and ended at 7.8%. Was that his fault? Can we concede that presidents\nhave limited influence on unemployment?</p>\n<p>Then there&#39;s decreasing median income. Fewer jobs, lower average income: very\nsimple. Median income peaked at the end of the Clinton years; it&#39;s been falling\nsince, with a minor increase 2004-2007. Our tax policy favors the wealthy. Is it\nsurprising average citizens aren&#39;t doing well?</p>\n<p>Next: gasoline prices, which parallel the global economy. If Obama is\nresponsible for increased fuel prices, he&#39;s also responsible for the economic\nimprovement. If it&#39;s just about price, the record high occurred during the Bush\nadministration.</p>\n<p>Finally, national debt: federal debt increased 51% during Obama&#39;s first term.\nWhy is Corso complaining now? I don&#39;t remember his complaint when the debt\nnearly doubled during the Bush, Jr. administration or tripled during the Reagan\nyears. For Bush Sr. it grew by 54%.</p>\n<p>Our president bears little blame for the economic mess. These are nobody&#39;s stale\ntalking points. They are simple economic facts.</p>\n"

The main argument was one of reductio ad\nabsurdum, demonstrating that a strict constructionist approach led to\nconclusions that are patently absurd.  I assumed any reasonably bright reader\nwouldn&#39;t need the details spelled out.  I should have realized that Mr. Prentice\nwouldn&#39;t get it.</p>\n<p>I believe Congress had the authority to legislate on all the items I listed, but\na strict constructionist would disagree.  Perhaps Mr. Prentice is right about\nthe highways, but regarding the others he disputes, I challenge him to find a\nclause providing for the flag or the air force.</p>\n<p>When it comes to taxes, the equal protection clause is entirely irrelevant.  For\nall singles of whatever background, eligible income below $8,350 is taxed at 10%\nand all of it above $372,950 is taxed at 35%, etc.  Note that his notion that\nthe fifth or fourteenth amendment could trump the sixteenth is fairly bizarre.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice says our constitution is not a living document.  I disagree.   The\nentire legal history of our republic is one of continual refinement and\nredefinition.  A country founded on strict constructionism wouldn&#39;t likely have\nsurvived a generation.  The words of John Marshall, our greatest Supreme Court\njustice, are quite relevant.  Our constitution, he said, is &quot;intended to endure\nfor ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human\naffairs.&quot;</p>\n<p>Strict constructionism is an intellectually bankrupt legal philosophy. Even\nAntonin Scalia said, &quot;I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to\nbe.&quot;  When Sam Prentice claims that much of our government is illegitimate\nbecause the constitution does not specifically allow for it, he is struggling to\nhold on to a discredited view of our country that has held sway only among a\nsmall cadre of libertarian scholars, not with the founders, not with most\nscholars, not with the judges, and not with the people.  I will allow Mr.\nPrentice the last word, but when he does respond, remember that it&#39;s easy to\nstate one&#39;s opinion, but opinions without substantial arguments to back them up\nshould never be taken too seriously.</p>\n"

She&#39;s probably right\nthat the budget would have passed if we&#39;d cut the truck, even though that would\nonly save about $20 per person and would over a few years cost taxpayers even\nmore money; people are funny that way. Her comments on the FOI laws are probably\naccurate, although some of what she said about the Town Charter and Ordinances\nare probably not borne out by the opinion rendered by our town attorney.</p>\n<p>But she&#39;s way off base with her comments on stacking the meeting. I may be one\nof the people she believes is doing the stacking. I urge people to attend, even\npeople who haven&#39;t been paying much attention to the budget. If I&#39;d been able to\nencourage just a few more to get out and vote yes, I guess I would have stacked\nthe referendum too.</p>\n<p>A democracy is best served by participation. It is not a bad thing when people\nmake it to the meeting. It is a very good thing. It would be great for our town\nif turnout were better than the measly three or four percent of registered\nvoters that make it to town meetings and the under twenty percent that make it\nfor referendums.</p>\n<p>The concern that these people have not been paying attention is legitimate but\noverblown. Residents have a real stake in services provided by the town and the\ncosts of those services. Showing up to discuss the budget is a very good thing,\neven if many of us cannot afford the time to attend all the Selectmen and\nFinance meetings. This is not laziness or apathy. We have family and work\nobligations and other forms of community involvement.</p>\n<p>I serve on the Board of Education, the Website Committee, and the Capital\nImprovement Commission. I am a member of the PTA and coach youth sports. Besides\nall this, I have a full-time job and need to somehow squeeze in as much time as\nI can with my wife and two young children; I won&#39;t take any more time from my\nschedule to observe the budgeting process. But I will continue to show up for\ntown meetings and referendums as often as possible. And I encourage friends and\nneighbors to do the same.</p>\n<p>We&#39;re not stacking the meetings.

    "Content": "<p>The most recent Andover Town Meeting was a fiasco.  Oh, it was more civil than\nmany meetings.  No one stormed out.  Few harsh words were spoken.  But it\naccomplished nothing.  The reason for this meeting is to adopt a budget to send\nto town-wide referendum.  And if that can&#39;t be accomplished, the meeting should\ngive clear guidance to the Board of Finance as to how the proposed budget should\nbe altered.  This meeting managed to do neither.</p>\n<p>There was a total of one motion to reduce the budget.  With this motion, Ed Nagy\nproposed a 1% across-the-board cut on all general town accounts except those\nalready reduced.  That motion was soundly defeated.  But at least Mr. Nagy made\na positive contribution.  Everyone else who voted no on the budget did so\nwithout offering a single motion to reduce even a penny from the budget\nproposal.</p>\n<p>There were brief discussions about cutting various items, including the\nelementary school budget, town office-holders&#39; salaries, and snow removal.\nWithout any motions made though, the Board of Finance cannot know if these were\nthe ideas of the majority of voters or only of a small group.</p>\n<p>Those who went to the meeting should feel proud of participating in our\ndemocracy.  But those who voted against the proposed budget without offering any\nconcrete alternatives need to think a little more about what they accomplished.\nAt least we won&#39;t incur the costs of running an unnecessary referendum, but we\nmust still be spending a few hundred dollars in postage and precious hours of\nour own time on yet another town meeting.</p>\n<p>I personally believe the proposed budget is under funded.  But the charter\nprohibits the Town Meeting from increasing it.  I&#39;m starting to wonder if our\nTown Meeting / referendum approval method is fundamentally unworkable.  It seems\nthat the way it now works is that the Board of Finance works very hard to\npresent a mostly reasonable initial budget, then we run through a few iterations\nof painful reductions after failures at town meetings or referendums until\neveryone is too tired of fighting it out and an under funded budget squeaks\nthrough.  Is this how we really want our town to function?  Do we need to change\nthe charter?</p>\n<p>Please come to next Tuesday&#39;s Town Meeting not to gripe but to help build a\nworkable budget.</p>\n"

The mill rate\nactually decreased in the latest budget.  The new mill rate is 26.3.  That means\nthat the average bottom-line increase over the last two years is 2.54%.  Our\nprevious administration overspent several years&#39; budgets so much that we ended\nup $750,000 in debt.  If we add just a third of that to the 05-06 budget, the\naverage annual spending increase is only 1.22%.  If we compare to last year the\nnumbers look higher, because last year, with the financial fiasco hanging over\nour heads, we removed everything we could in order to pass a budget.  Even so,\nfocusing on the bottom-line increase isn&#39;t that important.  Most of us are more\ninterested in how our taxes are affected.  This year&#39;s tax increase is 4.24%.\nIf you compare it to 2005, the average annual increase is 1.13%.  Including\none-third of the surcharge in the 2005-06 budget we get an actual average annual\ndecrease of 0.62% per year!</p>\n<p>Once again, complaints have been published that we didn&#39;t have up-to-date\nyear-to-date figures at the Town Meeting.  Having three-week old figures was\nunfortunate, but expecting up-to-the-minute numbers is missing the point.  No\nsignificant budget can possibly get each line item right.  The question at the\nend of the year is how far off were the various lines, and how close was the\noverall total?  I&#39;m sure this year energy costs were underestimated and snow\nremoval was overestimated; that doesn&#39;t proves much.  Using these incomplete\nnumbers to adjust spending priorities simply invites trouble.</p>\n<p>Once again, salaries of elected officials are under discussion.

The Board of Finance, whose diligence and accord has been\ninstrumental in undoing the mess, is now squabbling.  Others are proposing\nsqueezing out a few more nickels.</p>\n<p>A supplemental tax paid off previous years&#39; overspending.  But we slashed basic\nservices.  The rainy day fund is almost dry.  Our roads are falling apart.  This\nyear&#39;s budget takes baby steps towards rectifying these problems.  The increase\nlooks high because last year&#39;s budget was so low, decreasing non-educational\nspending 20%.  The current proposed tax increase is 4.2% and the average\nbottom-line increase for the past two years is only 2.5%.  If you include the\nmoney previously overspent, this year&#39;s is lower than the 05-06 budget.  We\naren&#39;t overspending.</p>\n<p>Some claim officials&#39; salaries are too high and other employees received little.\nNonsense.  The salaries are still well below what comparable officials in most\ntowns receive.  Other employees may get too little; this should be addressed by\nthe Board of Finance.  But elected officials&#39; salaries are set by a town\nmeeting.  We did that.  I&#39;m sorry some don&#39;t like the results, but that&#39;s how\ndemocracy works.</p>\n<p>A member of the Board of Finance recommends rejecting the budget.  This is\ndisturbing.  On the Board of Education, we hash things out at our public\nmeetings, but once a decision is made, we don&#39;t publicly criticize it.  Whether\nwe agree with one another or not, we don&#39;t snipe, we don&#39;t bicker; we present a\nunited face.  It&#39;s a shame the Board of Finance can&#39;t do the same.  The most\nconservative and the most liberal members of the board and several former First\nSelectmen spoke in favor of the budget.  It&#39;s disappointing to see members\nbreaking this accord.</p>\n<p>The proposed cuts don&#39;t mean much in a $10 million budget.  All the cuts\ndiscussed don&#39;t even total the $27,000 that would reduce the mill rate 0.1\npoints.  That&#39;s 0.27% of the budget, or $9 per capita.  For my family of four,\nit&#39;s around $3 per month.  If we have that much surplus at the end of the year,\nlet&#39;s improve our emergency fund.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s get together and vote to pass this reasonable budget.  Let&#39;s end the silly\nseason!</p>\n"

His expertise in the building trades has helped us improve and\nmaintain an excellent facility in a cost-effective manner.  And as a parent\ninvolved in the schools and as a sports coach, Mark has done a great deal for\nAndover&#39;s children.</p>\n<p>Danny brings unusual skills to the Board.  His profession involves risk\nmanagement for a large school system.  He brings expertise in insurance,\ncontracts, building security, and other risk-related concerns.  Each of these\nskills is hard to find in a small community; to have them all in on one\nindividual is a rare opportunity.</p>\n<p>Both Mark and Danny are congenial and even-tempered.  They will help raise the\nlevel of discourse on the Board.  Moreover they are certain to garner the\nrespect of other members and so will be able to effectively promote Andover&#39;s\ninterests.</p>\n<p>So I urge all Andover residents to split your ticket across party lines and vote\nfor Danny Holtsclaw and Mark Madore for the RHAM Board of Education.</p>\n"

After seeing\nthis over and over, I thought it time to collect some actual facts with clear\ncitations to sources. I am no expert, but I am scientifically literate, and know\nhow to perform basic online research.</p>\n<p>I understand that those pushing these lies will accuse me of being a shill for\nsomething: the government, the drug companies, the <a href=\"#/2021-03-19/\">mainstream media</a>, but\ntheir conspiracy theories don&#39;t interest me.  We know how inept our government\ncan be; there is absolutely no way that it could ever sustain the wide-ranging\nconspiracy they seem to imagine.  Instead, I contend, it&#39;s these folks listening\nto the echo chambers of the same few sources, many with financial interests tied\nto denying various truths.  (See also: global warming, tobacco, gun safety.)</p>\n<p>While I may eventually try to add some structure to this, right now it&#39;s just a\nsimple list of the lies and their corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"false-treatments\">False Treatments</h3>\n<h4 id=\"claim\">Claim</h4>\n<p>Writers are claiming that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for Covid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If [Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin] had been rightfully approved as\neffective treatments, thousands of lives could&#39;ve been saved and the\n&#39;pandemic&#39; would&#39;ve been easily subdued.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice/\">Sam Prentice</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Ivermectin, by the way, won a Pulitzer<sup>1</sup> and has\nlong been used to treat humans as well as livestock.  It appears to be safe\nwith no drug interaction. In 20 randomized trials it showed significantly\nlarge benefits in treating COVID-19.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Carol+Johnson/\">Carol Johnson</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup><strong>Note</strong>: presumably she&#39;s referring to the 2015 Nobel Prize\nin Physiology or Medicine for Ivermectin&#39;s creators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"truth\">Truth</h4>\n<p>Ivermectin is considered something of a wonder-drug... in the treatment of\nparasites such as worms and mites.  Studies have been done, and some are\nongoing, on its potential effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which\ncauses Covid.  Some early clinical evidence offered hope that this might be a\nuseful therapy.  But the clinical trials have not bourne this out.  The dosages\nthat would be required to help -- even if the in-vitro minor effect is not\nsimply a chimera -- are far too high for the human body, with neurologic and\nother significant side effects.</p>\n<p>The best scientific overview seems to be by <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015017.pub2/full\">Popp, Stegemann, <em>et. al.</em></a>.\nTheir conclusion is that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;[T]he reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin\nfor treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized\ncontrolled trials.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The developer and manufacturer of Ivermectin, Merck, has of course been looking\ninto this.  With their own vaccine research halted and no promising therapeutics\nin their pipeline, they would love to have this medicine repurposed.  But <a href=\"https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">their\nstatement</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[O]ur analysis has identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from\npre-clinical studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in\npatients with COVID-19 disease, and;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As usual, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_drug_repurposing_research#Ivermectin\">Wikipedia article</a> is a good starting place to gather\nadditional information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lethality\">Lethality</h3>\n<h4 id=\"claim-1\">Claim</h4>\n<p>We&#39;ve seen this one a few times now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The [Covid] virus is no more deadly than the yearly flu</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Gary+Gile/\">Gary Gile</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"truth-1\">Truth</h4>\n<p>Since March, 2020, more than one in every five hundred Americans has died from\nCovid.  There have been over 675,000 deaths out of 42 million cases.  The case\nfatality rate in the US is around 1.6%.  The best source of such information is\nprobably the Johns Hopkins <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\">Coronavirus Resarch Center</a>.  The\n<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">Mortality Analysis</a> page captures these statistics per country.</p>\n<p>U.S. Flu deaths, by contrast, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html\">average about</a> 36,000 per year out of roughly\n30 million cases each year, implying a case fatality rate of 0.12%.</p>\n<p>The Lancet published an <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2213-2600(20)30527-0/fulltext\">interesting study</a> on the differences in outcomes\nfor hospitalized patients with Covid and the Flu, which, while not as drastic\nin details as the full numbers above, points out that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the number of observed deaths was considerably higher than what would\nbe expected if the COVID-19 population had the same probability of dying as the\ninfluenza population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

They tell us that\n&quot;The U.S. is not a democracy; it is a republic.&quot;  This is entirely wrong.  In\nfact, the U.S. is both a republic and a democracy.</p>\n<p>We are a republic because we have no monarch.  We are a democracy because we\nregularly elect out lawmakers.  It really is that simple.</p>\n<p>The false dichotomy has been very prominent lately as conservatives want to\npromote the status quo in opposition to popular will.  They&#39;ll cite founders who\nwere very nervous about democracy and the tyranny of the majority.  They are\nright; founders such as Hamilton and Adams were skeptical.  But others such as\nPaine and Jefferson were more enthusiastic. (Note that the party created by\nJefferson and Madison was initially known as the Democratic-Republicans.)</p>\n<p>But much more important is the country we are now.  You might notice some\nchanges over the years, including enfranchisement of women, former slaves,\nother people of color, and adults as young as 18.  We&#39;ve started direct\nelection of Senators, added presidential electors for the District of\nColumbia, and banned the poll tax.

This site has <a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/\">terrible\nratings</a> on media analysts sites, and I&#39;ve seen it to contain barely\nresearched climate articles mixed in with various right-wing content. Reading it\ntoday, the first climate article was\n<a href=\"https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/leaders-in-the-race-to-net-zero/\">https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/leaders-in-the-race-to-net-zero/</a>.</p>\n<p>I added a comment to its nonsense; I don&#39;t know if the modertor will approve.\nIt&#39;s included below.</p>\n<p>For context, the article was incredibly brief, saying only</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On March 21, 2022 the Shetland Islands were <em>leaders in the race to net zero</em>.\nBy April 2023, ninety-six percent of the population will be in fuel poverty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then linking to the following two articles, quoting the first two paragraphs\nof each directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/03/02/the-remote-shetland-islands-are-a-surprising-leader-in-the-race-to-net-zero\">https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/03/02/the-remote-shetland-islands-are-a-surprising-leader-in-the-race-to-net-zero</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/01/fuel-poverty-could-hit-anyone-earning-under-120k-on-these-remote-uk-islands?dicbo=v2-dfe8ddef87cb6d67c0e3327dfa8f0dba\">https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/01/fuel-poverty-could-hit-anyone-earning-under-120k-on-these-remote-uk-islands?dicbo=v2-dfe8ddef87cb6d67c0e3327dfa8f0dba</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My comment follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you really expect people to see those two headlines and conclude that\nmoving toward net-zero is causing the Shetland’s fuel poverty? Do you believe\nyour audience is really that stupid? Do they not read the linked articles? Do\nyou?</p>\n<p>Because if you did, you would learn from the first one that the Shetland\nIslands are already — and have long been — among the most fuel-poor in\nBritain, despite the long history of oil extraction in their region.</p>\n<p>You would further learn that the wind farms in development for a decade and\ndue to come online in 2024 are expected to radically change this situation,\nthat the islands are investing in innovative hydrogen extraction technologies\nin part to use some of their excess energy because they will be generating\nmore wind energy than they can use and more than the current infrastructure\nwill allow them to export.</p>\n<p>So the question is simple: do you actually believe the things you’re implying\nin the face of the very evidence you supply, or are you trying to manipulate\nwhat you see as a stupid audience into believing a lie?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The response from that site was similiarly brief:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem was created by government focusing on unreliable green energy\nwhile shutting down their reliable energy sources. Perhaps you should use\nless insults and instead try using your brain?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which I replied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither article says anything remotely like that. It’s not that they’ve been\nshutting down anything, and the likely PM is talking about increasing nearby\noffshore drilling for oil and gas. But that’s not likely to help. In fact, “New\noil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually\nsold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel\nthe climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>The problem is that the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\nhas worsened the overall energy situation across Europe, and that it’s much\nworse in such a far-flung British region. Moreover the timing is terrible, since\nit’s only about eighteen months until the new cleaner, cheaper system comes\nonline.</p>\n<p>But there is no indication at all in either article or in the juxtaposition of\nthem that the green energy investment had anything at all to do with the current\ncrisis.</p>\n<p>Your posting the two together to try to prove something is disingenuous at best.\nIf you’ve actually read and understood both articles, then it’s far worse: it’s\ncrassly manipulative.</p>\n<p>Someone pointed to this site as one that had strong counterarguments to the\nglobal warming consensus. Although I’d seen it before and was turned off by the\novertly political things that fill up the front page, I decided to give it\nanother look. This is the first climate article I saw. If it’s any indication of\nthe quality of this site, then it’s definitely not worth my time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There has been no further response as of this writing, two weeks later.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another gem is at <a href=\"https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/truth-and-community/\">https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/truth-and-community/</a>,\nwhich simply tries to make a point using a ridiculous logical fallacy.  You can\nread it or simply get the gist from my [comment][co1], which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The linked article is titled “While the Climate Always Has and Always Will\nChange, There Is no Climate Crisis.”</p>\n<p>A fact-checker partnered with Facebook said that this is false, and you take\nthis to mean, “Facebook fact-checkers determined … earth’s climate didn’t used\nto change” ?!!!</p>\n<p>You really do think your audience is extremely stupid, huh? Perhaps they are, I\ndon’t know. Any bright five-year-old should see through this attempted\nmisdirection.</p>\n<p>To say that “While A is true, B is not” is false, is not to make any claim at\nall about A. The sentence is about B, and the subordinate clause is entirely\nirrelevant to the discussion.</p>\n<p>They were clearly and obviously saying that “there is no climate crisis” is\nfalse. Anything else is sophism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

I&#39;m very happy with the theme\nswitching, though, and it gave me the chance to combine CSS variables with\ndynamic SVGs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback</h2>\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear any feedback of a technical nature, suggestions for the code,\nbetter UX or graphical designs, or anything else.  Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:scott@sauyet.com\">email me</a>\nor to raise a <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/issues/new\">new issue</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/issues/new\">pull request</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://github.com/buzzdecafe\">Mike H</a> for helpful feedback already given!</p>\n"
