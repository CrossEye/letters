Also unsurprising, <a href=\"#/person/Don+Denley\">Don Denley</a> takes a different tack. He weasels,\nclaiming to condemn the violence but drawing unjustified parallels with other\nrecent events.</p>\n<p>Where to start? How about this? &quot;It would be difficult to ascertain whether they\nwere infiltrated by members of Antifa... but it&#39;s entirely possible.&quot; This\nsounds like, &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; It is the worst kind of\nweaseling, making a claim by pretending it&#39;s an open question. Well it&#39;s not\ntrue. This has been fact-checked, and it&#39;s an unvarnished lie.\n(<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/8\">http://sauyet.com/link/8</a>)</p>\n<p>Or how about this? &quot;I was deeply saddened to see a young Air Force female --\nunarmed -- shot to death by security. [...] Just imagine if this officer had\nshot and killed a Black Lives Matter protester.&quot; Funny, I don&#39;t recall Mr.\nDenley critiquing the police violence marring otherwise peaceful BLM protests\nthis summer. Is it that clubs and cruisers and pepper spray are fine but guns\nare not? Yes, these were mostly peaceful protests, with violence usually\ninstigated by the police. See <a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/9\">http://sauyet.com/link/9</a>. And &quot;a young Air Force\nfemale&quot;?! Does anyone believe that he would have written &quot;a young Air Force\nmale&quot;? Why does her gender matter?</p>\n<p>And how about calling Antifa &quot;a large, violent, anti-government organization?&quot;\nObviously he cites no evidence for this. There is none. Antifa is a loosely knit\ncollection of opponents of fascism across the country. They promote direct\naction, sometimes even violence, and many on the left criticize them for that,\nbut there is little actual violence. Of course, the right-wing has perpetrated\nthe majority of all recent US terrorist incidents. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/10\">http://sauyet.com/link/10</a>)</p>\n<p>Mr. Denley, weaseling demeans you. If you believe something, state it. If you\nclaim to have facts, please cite some sources.</p>\n"},{"Title":"How to Fact Check","Date":"2020-12-19","Tags":["Fact Checking"],"People":["Sam Prentice","George Kitchin","Ed Kozlowski"],"Content":"<p>Fact-checking is straightforward. When something makes your blood boil, test\nwhether it passes muster. Check your sources with\n<a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/</a>, which describes media sources&#39; biases and\naccuracy. We can safely ignore an outlet like like oann.com (questionable\nsource, factual: low). One like washingtonpost.com (left-center bias, factual:\nhigh), is trustworthy on facts, but might present bias in story\nchoice/headlines.</p>\n<p>To test a story, look to the fact-checkers. My favorites are FactCheck.org\n(least biased, factual: very high), Snopes.com (least biased, factual: high),\nand PolitiFact.com (least biased, factual: high).</p>\n<p>Recent letters fail basic fact-checking. <a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> reiterates claims that\nBiden promoted election fraud. Snopes says: False. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/1\">http://sauyet.com/link/1</a>)\nIt&#39;s like claiming the police&#39;s Homicide Squad is there to commit homicides. Or\nhe misquotes Biden&#39;s, &quot;I don&#39;t only need you to get me elected; I need you once\nI&#39;m elected&quot; by dropping the &quot;only&quot;, which he would have discovered reading\nPolitifact (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/2\">http://sauyet.com/link/2</a>). The rest is similarly absurd, but it&#39;s\nworth countering that the 81 million people voted either for the candidate who\nkept us safe by following health guidelines, or against the candidate whose\nsuperspreader rallies risked more deaths.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#/person/George+Kitchin\">George Kitchin</a> gets just one thing right. Snopes explains that yes, those\nnotorious cages were built under Obama. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/3\">http://sauyet.com/link/3</a>) But, as\nFactCheck points out (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/4\">http://sauyet.com/link/4</a>), Trump&#39;s blanket policy was what\ncaused vast family separations. His claim about Gold Star families is laughable;\nsee the Wikipedia page about it. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/5\">http://sauyet.com/link/5</a>) So is suggesting\nthat Trump only insulted reporters under massive provocation. Reporting\ndemonstrable lies is not insulting. See, for instance, <a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/6\">http://sauyet.com/link/6</a>.\nRegarding his absurdities on the ACA and Covid: extraordinary claims require\nextraordinary proof. Where&#39;s his evidence?</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Kozlowski\">Ed Kozlowski</a>, the poor dear, who must have been bullied by a\nprogressive during his childhood. His letter presents no actual facts to\ndispute.</p>\n"},{"Title":"Election Conspiracy Theory","Date":"2020-12-06","Tags":["Elections","Joe Biden","Donald Trump"],"People":["Sam Prentice"],"Content":"<p>Misquoting Biden and quoting him out of context (see the usual fact-checkers),\n<a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> asserts monstrous election fraud. He presents no evidence and it&#39;s\nobvious why: because there is none. Conspiracy theories postulate a grand cabal\nout to deny Trump a second term: Republicans and Democrats, governors,\nlegislators, election officials, postal workers, voting machine makers, polling\nworkers, and, I&#39;m guessing, Santa&#39;s elves. But I&#39;ll let you in on a little\nsecret. There actually is a large group trying to oust Trump: the American\npeople. Sorry about that.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not only that there&#39;s no evidence. The Trump campaign has repeatedly\nlitigated these claims in court. His results: 1 win, 46 losses. Someone call\nGuinness Book: has any plaintiff lost so many cases in one month?</p>\n<p>Speaking of one month, in 2016, fans here credited Trump for the post-election\nstock market bump. It was impressive, a one-month jump of 7.01% in. I&#39;m\nwondering, do those same people credit Biden for the rise of 9.03% this past\nmonth?</p>\n<p>Anyway, absent any evidence, those peddling huge election fraud are simply\nconspiracy theorists. As heard recently, &quot;Don&#39;t laugh at kids for believing in\nSanta Claus; some adults believe Trump won the election.&quot;</p>\n"},{"Title":"How to Pretend to Win an Argument","Date":"2020-11-20","Tags":["Democracy","Republic","Electoral College"],"People":["Sam Prentice"],"Content":"<p>How to pretend to win an argument: You say, &quot;X is true.&quot; Your opponent says,\n&quot;No, here&#39;s the evidence against X.&quot; You say, &quot;How can you possibly deny Y?&quot;</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> says, &quot;We&#39;re not a democracy&quot; and I respond with arguments\ndemonstrating that we are in fact a democracy, what was his response? He says\nthat I am &quot;disputing that we are a republic&quot;. This is plain dishonesty.</p>\n<p>A republic is a government designed to benefit the people rather than its\nleaders. That&#39;s all it means. Most countries currently are republics. A\ndemocracy is a government in which the citizenry can, directly or through\nrepresentatives, choose the laws and leaders. There is no contradiction between\nthe two. The U.S. is both a republic (because we have no monarch) and a\nrepresentative democracy (because we elect our lawmakers and executives.)</p>\n<p>The rest of his letter contains unsubstantiated claims of voting irregularities\nand an unnecessary primer on federalism and the Electoral College. Yes, that&#39;s\nhow the Electoral College works. I&#39;m simply suggesting that, as we&#39;ve done\nnumerous times in the past, we should expand our democracy. Direct election of\nthe president would be a great way to\nstart.</p>\n"},{"Title":"An Actual Democracy","Date":"2020-11-07","Tags":["Democracy","Electoral College","Constitution","Federalist Papers"],"People":["Sam Prentice"],"Content":"<p><a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> gets it wrong again. Yes, some of the founders (notably Adams and\nHamilton) were suspicious of democracy. Others (Jefferson, Paine) were\nsympathetic. Within a generation, we were regularly described as a democracy.\nMany great quotes on democracy came from Jackson, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, and\nReagan.</p>\n<p>The 14th, 15th, 17th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th Amendments and arguably various\nothers, expanded our democratic features. Yes, we have democracy-limiting checks\nand balances, but we&#39;ve gradually grown more accustomed to &quot;a government of the\npeople, by the people, and for the people.&quot;</p>\n<p>The recent conservative mantra about not being a democracy defends remaining\nanti-democratic provisions: the Electoral college and state&#39;s equal weighting in\nthe Senate. This is ideology trying to retain power, nothing more.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice cites the Federalist Papers in defending the Electoral College.\n(Odd, isn&#39;t it, how small-government conservatives love to promote the\nFederalist Papers whose sole purpose was to argue for a more powerful, more\ncentralized government?) The relevant one, #68, described a collection of\ndeliberative bodies, nothing resembling the modern Electoral College. 2016\nembodied the complete failure of Hamilton&#39;s goals.</p>\n<p>We are a democracy. We&#39;d become a better one by eliminating the Electoral\nCollege.</p>\n"},{"Title":"Our Neighbor","Date":"2020-10-25","Tags":["Endorsement","Connecticut","Mr. Rogers"],"People":["John Collins"],"Content":"<p>After the dueling presidential town halls, one Trump aide referred to Joe Biden\nas Mr. Rogers.

She voted against banning bump stocks.\nAfter Sandy Hook, Connecticut knows the tragedy of gun violence. This sensible\nbill prevents mass shooters from turning semi-automatic weapons fully automatic.\nIt passed without her, and the Justice Department soon took the same position.\nBut Ms. Green&#39;s NAY is a stain upon our district.</p>\n<p>Second, she voted against a paid family and medical leave system in Connecticut.\nIt&#39;s hard to understand why.

This election, with the\nmess the Republican party has made of our country, I will not vote for any\nRepublicans who don&#39;t publicly disavow the corrupt Donald Trump, not even for\ndogcatcher.

A barrage of accounts report voter suppression efforts. For decades\nRepublicans have been barred from mounting poll-watching campaigns, because it&#39;s\nalways attempts to deter minority voting. The ban lifted, and they&#39;re starting\nback up. The intelligence community warns that Russia is at it again. In the\nCovid era, when states expanded vote-by-mail options, Trump&#39;s flunky sabotaged\nour mail delivery system. When Biden called them out, the fact-checkers said,\n&quot;Hold on! You don&#39;t have any evidence.&quot; Then Trump -- with a penchant for saying\nthe quiet things out loud -- publicly confessed, and they said, &quot;Never mind.\nBiden was right.&quot; (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/mail-fiddle\">http://bit.ly/mail-fiddle</a>)</p>\n<p>Trump and the remaining GOP fragments are putting their thumbs on the scale. How\ndo they respond to critics? Trump repeatedly asserts long-debunked claims that\nmail-in ballots are fraudulent, that millions of non-citizens vote, that China\nis trying to hack the election toward Biden.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> follows the same theme, He casts minor distinctions in mailed\nballots categories as major fault lines. He radically misstates Federal law\nabout voter roll purging. (Federal law does not mandate it, instead offering\nsignificant restrictions on state processes.) He warns about substantial voter\nfraud, a non-issue according to experts. He says, &quot;Democrats don&#39;t just want to\nwin by cheating.

Most of us present-day liberals easily\nrecognize that Jim Crow and America&#39;s horrifying history of racial strife was\nfor decades concentrated in the Democratic party. Do you think we should care?\nToday, that ideology is dominant in the Republican party. The &quot;party of Lincoln&quot;\nhas undergone many changes in fundamental ideology over its history, swinging\nbetween concern for property and concern for equality. The pendulum currently\nfavors property. (See Heather Cox Richardson&#39;s <em>To Make Men Free</em> for details.)\nCurrently there is more room for liberal ideas in the Democratic Party, so\nthat&#39;s where we&#39;ve been most active.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m afraid there has been a change over the last few decades, especially over\nthe last four years. The Republican party has enabled the misbehavior of the\nmost corrupt, most incompetent, and, I&#39;m willing to say, the most evil president\nour country has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Our answer is simple. We are going to have to adopt some partisanship. For the\nnext few years, we are going to refuse to vote for <em>any</em> Republican who does not\npublicly and loudly disavow Donald Trump and all he stands for. Not for\nPresident. Not for Senator, Governor, School Board, or Dogcatcher. We&#39;re not\nalone. The Lincoln Project, the Bulwark, Republican Voters Against Trump, and\nothers show that this is still not coming from a narrow ideological group. This\nis widespread disgust.</p>\n<p>Republican candidates, please be on notice. We have not before been particularly\npartisan. But Trump has pushed us that way.

Conservatism promotes competition and the virtue of selfishness. It\nargues that freedom arises when individuals compete in literal and philosophical\nmarketplaces for selfish goals. Modern liberalism says there is also benefit in\ncooperation. It notes that governments and other institutions arise as\ncooperative associations for mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>Who resists wearing a face mask?</p>\n<p>Conservatives, of course. &quot;Wearing a mask does not protect me from the virus.\nWhy should I erode my freedom, consenting to this tyrannical and uncomfortable\nfashion accessory?&quot; (That these same people insist that bulletproof backpacks,\narmed school guards, and live-shooter drills are just the price of freedom is a\nfuture discussion.)</p>\n<p>They&#39;re correct. Face masks do little to protect wearers. Liberals agree; why\ndon&#39;t they also object? Simple: liberals understand we are part of a society.\nGroup well-being sometimes trumps personal choices. Wearing a mask does not\nprotect me; it protects those around me.

There is\nmuch to be said for them, but they are not a panacea.  Let&#39;s look at\nsome of the downsides to free markets.</p>\n<p>There are many ways in which markets do not provide what society deems\nappropriate.  Let&#39;s start with what we market.  A regulation-free\neconomy would allow the unscrupulous to provide slaves. It would allow\nchild labor.  It would allow lead paint in children&#39;s toys.  It could\nnot demand truthful advertising or require accurate ingredient labels.\nTo say that we would fix these flaws by law is already to distort free\nmarkets.</p>\n<p>Free markets provide many goods and services, but there are many\nothers they cannot provide.  How about public goods, such as courts,\nthe military, firefighters, police, roads?  There is no incentive for\nan individual to pay for them, so there is no incentive for someone to\nsell them.  Do free-market worshipers think we should just do without\nthem?</p>\n<p>And what about when economic exchanges adversely affects someone other\nthan the participants, known as &quot;negative externalities&quot;?  A free\nmarket offers little ways to prevent industrial pollution, to inhibit\noverfishing, to avoid antibiotic resistant pathogens.</p>\n<p>Free markets also face power imbalances.  How bad would cell service\nbe and how high would prices be in five years if Verizon bought all\nits major competitors today?  When the trust-busters broke up Standard\nOil or AT&amp;T, they were helping consumers, who had no power of their\nown.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest problem in free markets is that they recognize\nonly the value of money.  If something does not have a price, it is\nnot considered valuable.  Things such as ethical standards have no\nprice-point, so the free markets reject them.

Let&#39;s try to see what that might mean.</p>\n<p>The American revolutionaries won their independence and put in place a small,\nweak government. They were not happy with it. They wrote the Constitution\nexpressly to give the national government more power. Anyone who wants to wrap\nhimself in both the spirit of the Constitution and the notion of a small\ngovernment must come to terms with that contradiction.</p>\n<p>But the Founders were afraid of investing too much power in any individual or\ninstitution. That sounds a lot like what I described for progressivism.\nProgressives worry about the concentration of power in the hands of the rich, of\nthe government, of corporations. The Constitution dealt with this concern in an\nintricate series of checks on each branch of government, on the federal\ngovernment as a whole, on the states, and even on the popular will of its\ncitizens.</p>\n<p>Returning to the spirit of the Constitution involves ensuring that no\nindividuals or institutions amass enough power to threaten the rest of us. Or\nthat at the very least there are counterbalancing institutions to keep them in\ncheck.</p>\n<p>Please remember that those who fought for independence, wrote the Declaration,\nwrote the Constitution, and served as our first generation of leaders were the\nprogressives of their day.

Did you realize that words can also be used to communicate with\nothers?</p>\n<p>And, on a more serious note, to <a href=\"#/person/Dick+Shea\">Dick Shea</a>: Instead of assuming that your fellow\nstate residents incompetently voted against their own interests, shouldn&#39;t\nyou consider that perhaps they simply disagree with you? I&#39;m on the other\nside, fairly happy with the state results and disappointed with the national\nones. I find it distressing that nationally voters held the Democrats\naccountable for not solving in two years the problems it took Republicans a\ngeneration to create. But I won&#39;t imply that the other side is stupid or\nincompetent. I wish you would extend us the same courtesy.</p>\n"},{"Title":"For The People","Date":"2010-10-12","Tags":["Economy","Deregulation","Tea Party","Republicans"],"People":["Margaret McCutcheon Faber","Robert Kodym","Dick Shea"],"Content":"<p>The last time the banks almost destroyed our economy, the United States pieced\ntogether a New Deal that said people are more important than big business and\nthat government would provide a check on corporate excesses. For the next two\ngenerations, our middle class grew and prospered and poverty fell sharply.</p>\n<p>But since then, three decades of deregulation have reversed this course. The\nmiddle class has stagnated, poverty has skyrocketed, and the only ones\nbenefiting are the rich. We&#39;ve managed to build a government of the wealthy, by\nthe wealthy, and for the wealthy. We&#39;ve even fought two wars in Iraq to promote\nthe interests of oil giants. (If you don&#39;t believe oil was the reason, answer\nthis: Would we have fought two wars there if Iraq was the world&#39;s third-largest\nproducer of carrots?) Meanwhile, the American dream has slipped further away\nfrom us. Once again the banks nearly destroyed our economy.</p>\n<p>An angry response has arisen, in the form of the Tea Party movements. The anger\nis legitimate, but it is not properly directed. For the past two years, the\nDemocrats have worked to restore some measure of sanity, to reiterate that\ngovernment is to serve the interests of the people, and not those of Wall\nStreet. The Republicans have opposed them in lock-step, promoting cynical\npolitical calculations rather than principled stands. We should be angry at\nthese Republicans.</p>\n<p>President Bush&#39;s TARP program prevented a total collapse of the banking system,\nbut when it came to adding accountability for those who caused the disaster, the\nRepublicans said no. President Obama&#39;s stimulus program has prevented the loss\nof millions more jobs, but when it came to expanding it to help additional\nsuffering Americans, the Republicans said no. And when the Democrats made a\ngenerations-overdue attempt to rein in the spiraling health-care costs, the\nRepublicans again said no. They&#39;ll claim concern for the deficit, but when they\nwere in charge, the federal debt rose at an historic 8.3% per year.</p>\n<p>Now in Connecticut, the Republicans are putting up multi-millionaire candidates\nfor office, using vast personal fortunes to try to buy their way into office. I\nguess they really do figure that if the government is going to be for the\nwealthy, it should be by the wealthy. They&#39;re wrong. The government should be on\nthe side of average Americans. To the party of No, we need to say one thing: No.</p>\n"}]

      <h1>About this Site</h1>
      <p>
          I am one of those gadflies who writes often to the local weekly paper.
          I've been doing it for years.  This page is collecting those letters 
          for posterity.  At the moment, the letters from 2012 to the present
          are included.  I will add more as I find time (and for older ones as I 
          find the letters themselves.) 
      </p>
      <p id="currentLetter"></p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions.
        That comes through in those letters.  I have covered topics such as 
        <a href="#/tag/Global+Warming">Global Warming</a>, the ideas of 
        <a href="#/tag/Progressivism">Progressivism</a>, 
        <a href="#/tag/Fact+Checking">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of 
        <a href="#/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a>, as well as 
        <a href="#/tags/">many others</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please
        remember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very
        important, the local ones, the national ones, and the global ones. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have in the past served in the local government of Andover, Connecticut
        (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning Commission,
        the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town Committee), all of
        the letters here represent my own views and not those of these organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,
        not the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>.  The dates are the dates I 
        wrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A few were never 
        published, and I never did try to determine why.  There may have been mild
        editing by the <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don't exactly match what was 
        published, but that's rare, and it never changes the meaning.
      </p>

        any comments or suggestions.
