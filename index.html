      <h1>Scott Sauyet's <em>Rivereast</em> Letters to the Editor</h1>
      <p>
          I am one of those gadflies who writes often to the local weekly paper.
          I've been doing it for years.  This page will collect those letters for posterity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="#/2021-03-04">most recent letter</a>, from March 4, 2021, is titled
        "The worst president ever", and covers the subject of 
        <a href="#/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions.
        That comes through in those letters.  I have covered topics such as 
        <a href="#/tag/Global+Warming">Global Warming</a>, the ideas of 
        <a href="#/tag/Progressivism">Progressivism</a>, 
        <a href="#/tag/Fact+Checking">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of 
        <a href="#/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a>, as well as 
        <a href="#/tags/">many others</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please
        remember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very
        important, the local ones, the national ones and the global ones. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have in the past served in Andover, Connecticut's local government
        (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning Commission,
        the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town Committee), all of
        the letters here represent my own views and not those of these organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,
        not the title supplied by the newspaper.  The dates are the dates I wrote them,
        not the issue date in which they appeared.  A few were never published, although
        I never did try to determine why.  There may have been mild editing by the 
        <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don't exactly match what was published, but 
        that's rare, and never changes the meaning.
