He weasels,\nclaiming to condemn the violence but drawing unjustified parallels with other\nrecent events.</p>\n<p>Where to start? How about this? &quot;It would be difficult to ascertain whether they\nwere infiltrated by members of Antifa... but it&#39;s entirely possible.&quot; This\nsounds like, &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; It is the worst kind of\nweaseling, making a claim by pretending it&#39;s an open question. Well it&#39;s not\ntrue. This has been fact-checked, and it&#39;s an unvarnished lie.\n(<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/8\">http://sauyet.com/link/8</a>)</p>\n<p>Or how about this? &quot;I was deeply saddened to see a young Air Force female --\nunarmed -- shot to death by security. [...] Just imagine if this officer had\nshot and killed a Black Lives Matter protester.&quot; Funny, I don&#39;t recall Mr.\nDenley critiquing the police violence marring otherwise peaceful BLM protests\nthis summer. Is it that clubs and cruisers and pepper spray are fine but guns\nare not? Yes, these were mostly peaceful protests, with violence usually\ninstigated by the police. See <a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/9\">http://sauyet.com/link/9</a>. And &quot;a young Air Force\nfemale&quot;?! Does anyone believe that he would have written &quot;a young Air Force\nmale&quot;? Why does her gender matter?</p>\n<p>And how about calling Antifa &quot;a large, violent, anti-government organization?&quot;\nObviously he cites no evidence for this. There is none. Antifa is a loosely knit\ncollection of opponents of fascism across the country. They promote direct\naction, sometimes even violence, and many on the left criticize them for that,\nbut there is little actual violence. Of course, the right-wing has perpetrated\nthe majority of all recent US terrorist incidents. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/10\">http://sauyet.com/link/10</a>)</p>\n<p>Mr. Denley, weaseling demeans you. If you believe something, state it.

Check your sources with\n<a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/</a>, which describes media sources&#39; biases and\naccuracy. We can safely ignore an outlet like like oann.com (questionable\nsource, factual: low). One like washingtonpost.com (left-center bias, factual:\nhigh), is trustworthy on facts, but might present bias in story\nchoice/headlines.</p>\n<p>To test a story, look to the fact-checkers. My favorites are FactCheck.org\n(least biased, factual: very high), Snopes.com (least biased, factual: high),\nand PolitiFact.com (least biased, factual: high).</p>\n<p>Recent letters fail basic fact-checking. <a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> reiterates claims that\nBiden promoted election fraud. Snopes says: False. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/1\">http://sauyet.com/link/1</a>)\nIt&#39;s like claiming the police&#39;s Homicide Squad is there to commit homicides. Or\nhe misquotes Biden&#39;s, &quot;I don&#39;t only need you to get me elected; I need you once\nI&#39;m elected&quot; by dropping the &quot;only&quot;, which he would have discovered reading\nPolitifact (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/2\">http://sauyet.com/link/2</a>). The rest is similarly absurd, but it&#39;s\nworth countering that the 81 million people voted either for the candidate who\nkept us safe by following health guidelines, or against the candidate whose\nsuperspreader rallies risked more deaths.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#/person/George+Kitchin\">George Kitchin</a> gets just one thing right. Snopes explains that yes, those\nnotorious cages were built under Obama. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/3\">http://sauyet.com/link/3</a>) But, as\nFactCheck points out (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/4\">http://sauyet.com/link/4</a>), Trump&#39;s blanket policy was what\ncaused vast family separations. His claim about Gold Star families is laughable;\nsee the Wikipedia page about it. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/5\">http://sauyet.com/link/5</a>) So is suggesting\nthat Trump only insulted reporters under massive provocation. Reporting\ndemonstrable lies is not insulting. See, for instance, <a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/6\">http://sauyet.com/link/6</a>.\nRegarding his absurdities on the ACA and Covid: extraordinary claims require\nextraordinary proof. Where&#39;s his evidence?</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Kozlowski\">Ed Kozlowski</a>, the poor dear, who must have been bullied by a\nprogressive during his childhood.

Conspiracy theories postulate a grand cabal\nout to deny Trump a second term: Republicans and Democrats, governors,\nlegislators, election officials, postal workers, voting machine makers, polling\nworkers, and, I&#39;m guessing, Santa&#39;s elves. But I&#39;ll let you in on a little\nsecret. There actually is a large group trying to oust Trump: the American\npeople. Sorry about that.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not only that there&#39;s no evidence. The Trump campaign has repeatedly\nlitigated these claims in court. His results: 1 win, 46 losses. Someone call\nGuinness Book: has any plaintiff lost so many cases in one month?</p>\n<p>Speaking of one month, in 2016, fans here credited Trump for the post-election\nstock market bump. It was impressive, a one-month jump of 7.01% in. I&#39;m\nwondering, do those same people credit Biden for the rise of 9.03% this past\nmonth?</p>\n<p>Anyway, absent any evidence, those peddling huge election fraud are simply\nconspiracy theorists.

A barrage of accounts report voter suppression efforts. For decades\nRepublicans have been barred from mounting poll-watching campaigns, because it&#39;s\nalways attempts to deter minority voting.

(See Heather Cox Richardson&#39;s <em>To Make Men Free</em> for details.)\nCurrently there is more room for liberal ideas in the Democratic Party, so\nthat&#39;s where we&#39;ve been most active.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m afraid there has been a change over the last few decades, especially over\nthe last four years. The Republican party has enabled the misbehavior of the\nmost corrupt, most incompetent, and, I&#39;m willing to say, the most evil president\nour country has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Our answer is simple. We are going to have to adopt some partisanship. For the\nnext few years, we are going to refuse to vote for <em>any</em> Republican who does not\npublicly and loudly disavow Donald Trump and all he stands for. Not for\nPresident. Not for Senator, Governor, School Board, or Dogcatcher. We&#39;re not\nalone. The Lincoln Project, the Bulwark, Republican Voters Against Trump, and\nothers show that this is still not coming from a narrow ideological group. This\nis widespread disgust.</p>\n<p>Republican candidates, please be on notice. We have not before been particularly\npartisan. But Trump has pushed us that way. Now we need to hear you denounce\nTrump and all he stands for, or we will actively work against your election.</p>\n"

Face masks do little to protect wearers. Liberals agree; why\ndon&#39;t they also object? Simple: liberals understand we are part of a society.\nGroup well-being sometimes trumps personal choices. Wearing a mask does not\nprotect me; it protects those around me. Having others wear masks protects me.</p>\n<p>&quot;But,&quot; sputter the conservatives, &quot;didn&#39;t Benjamin Franklin say, &#39;Those who\nwould give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve\nneither Liberty nor Safety?&#39;&quot; Yes.

It describes how since the 1950s there has been a\ncoordinated effort to discredit inconvenient science, how an overlapping cast of\ncharacters has been involved in denying that tobacco causes lung cancer, that\nReagan&#39;s Star Wars idea was infeasible, that power company emissions cause acid\nrain, that CFCs cause the ozone hole, that second-hand smoke is dangerous, and\nthat burning fossil fuels causes global warming.</p>\n<p>This process started with the tobacco companies. Because they had no reasonable\nway to attack the science heads-on, they formed an array of pseudo-independent\norganizations meant only to sow doubt about the science. They managed to\nconvince journalists to cover this as though there was actual scientific\ncontroversy. They kept this up forty years, selling many more cigarettes along\nthe way.</p>\n<p>This worked so well that although scientists made it clear that Reagan&#39;s Star\nWars wasn&#39;t possible, a small group used the tobacco play-book to attack the\nscience detailing nuclear winter. The same people then promoted acid rain\ndenial, ozone obfuscation, and the current project of denying global warming.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, the science is clear. But former cold warriors like Fred\nSinger, Robert Jastrow, Fred Leitz, and Bill Nierenberg made a career of\nmuddying the waters, trying to make us believe the answers are not\nwell-established. They found gullible journalists and bystanders to promote\ntheir fantasies.

The only articles I found\nwere two Google Docs from 2009 (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/weinstein-1\">http://bit.ly/weinstein-1</a> and\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/weintstein-2\">http://bit.ly/weintstein-2</a>).  They are not peer-reviewed, discuss only\natmospheric heat, and try to debunk statements never published.  But\nthe biggest issue I see is that his projections assume the entire 20th\ncentury&#39;s output of CO2 acreted linearly.  When you factor in the\naccelerating rate, his results are meaningless.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure Mr. Armstrong can add additional names; most would likely be\nsimilar, either non-experts chiming in or experts saying something\ndifferent than the contrarians claim.  There are legitimate climate\nscientists who disagree with the consensus; that&#39;s how science works.\nHowever most climate skeptics are coming at it backward: &quot;it will be\ndifficult to react to climate change, so let&#39;s fund a study to pretend\nit&#39;s not happening.&quot;</p>\n<p>What bothers me about the climate skeptic community is not the obvious\nconspiracy theory mentality; that&#39;s no longer noteworthy.  It&#39;s not\nthe scientific illiteracy; that&#39;s regrettable but understood.  What\nbothers me is the smugness of a group that thinks it has inside\ninformation everyone else is too brainwashed to recognize.  I remember\nduring high school in the 1980s when everyone who wanted to\ndemonstrate their individual non-conformity sported a Mohawk --\neveryone.  This is the same.</p>\n<p>Yes, it&#39;s true that scientific consensus is occasionally overthrown;\nsometimes an Einstein or a Darwin comes along to shake things up.  But\nunless one actually is Darwin or Einstein, claiming to see this shift\nahead of time is supercilious nonsense.</p>\n"

Reid, and Petr Chýlek.</p>\n<p>Robert Laughlin says the earth doesn&#39;t care and will outlast any\nproblems we create.  Dr. Laughlin is another scientist weighing in\nwhere he has no expertise, but the main point of his most famous\narticle (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/earth-knows\">http://bit.ly/earth-knows</a>) is that the earth has suffered\ngreat catastrophes before and survived.  I&#39;m afraid I root for\nhumanity and don&#39;t have his dispassionate approach.  While he disputes\nthe strength of the consensus opinion, he does accept it.</p>\n<p>Judith Curry, by contrast, has impeccable climatology credentials and\na position of leadership in the field.  If she were raising questions\nabout the reality of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), it would be\ninteresting news.  Instead, her most quoted article\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/curry-on-credibility\">http://bit.ly/curry-on-credibility</a>) simply objects to the science\ncommunity&#39;s political handling of climate controversy, an important\npoint certainly, but not relevant to the reality of AGW.</p>\n<p>For John T Reid, I find skeptical blog posts and industry articles but\nno academic qualifications or peer-reviewed articles.  Are there\nreliable references?</p>\n<p>I couldn&#39;t find the Petr Chýlek article quoted (&quot;Hiatus: Existence,\nCauses, and Future Temperature Projections&quot;.)  But I read some of his\nwork, and it&#39;s within the consensus formulation, questioning only the\ndegree of AGW.  He explains &quot;The Hiatus&quot;, a decade where surface air\ntemperature stopped growing.  This is important, given how skeptics\nemphasize this pause: only a bit more than 2% of the total heat in the\nsystem is in the atmosphere.  Over 93% is in the oceans.  When\natmospheric heat stopped rising, ocean heat didn&#39;t pause and global\ntemperatures continued their rapid rise.</p>\n<p>(Next week: Leonard Weinstein and conclusions on scientific consensus.)</p>\n"

The first\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/clouds-warm\">http://bit.ly/clouds-warm</a>), from Finland&#39;s Turku University claims\nclimate models ignore the effect of cloud coverage.  This paper is not\npeer-reviewed, citing few sources beyond the authors&#39; own (often\nunpublished) research.  They don&#39;t explain their data or methods.\nEssentially they note a correlation, then assert without evidence that\ncloud cover causes warming rather than the reverse.

What I did gather is that Earth&#39;s\nperiodic magnetic field reversal correlates to the glacial cycle.  I\nsee little here contradicting anthropogenic global warming; perhaps\nsomeone better at climatology can enlighten me.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong also quotes scientists. Ivar Giaever said, &quot;Global\nwarming has become a new religion.&quot;  Yes, there are skeptics.  In a\nworld that appreciates curiosity and freedom of expression, there\nalways will be.</p>\n<p>But if you heard that Joe Torre criticized the way Bill Belicheck\narranged his plays, you would listen politely; his obvious expertise\ncoaching baseball affords him some respect.  But he&#39;s not a football\ncoach; we cannot assume his expertise transfers.   Dr. Giaever is a\nNobel-prize winning physicist; we should listen respectfully to his\nscientific comments.  But a retired professor of physics is not a\nlikely contributor to climatology.  Moreover, his affiliation with the\nanti-science Heartland Institute makes his pronouncements\nquestionable.  This think tank plainly lets ideology and funding drive\nits science, rejecting the tobacco/cancer link and fighting the global\nwarming consensus.  Listen politely to Dr. Giaever, but don&#39;t count on\nhis understanding or objectivity.</p>\n<p>This goes double for mathematician David Evans and retired chemist Les Woodcock.</p>\n<p>(Next week: more scientists.)</p>\n"

        "Content": "<p><a href=\"#/person/Dan+Armstrong\">Dan Armstrong</a> argues that the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate\nchange is exaggerated, listing academics who challenge that consensus. I planned\na parody letter, listing professors rejecting evolution or promoting flat-earth\ntheories. It could have been amusing. But instead, over a few letters I will\ndiscuss the scientists Mr. Armstrong has presented. First, a few words about\nscience.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong says, &quot;Predicting future events based on past events is not\nexperimentally proven science; it is statistical forecasting.&quot; No, creating\nprediction models is exactly what science does, combining past events and\ntheoretical understanding in varying proportions. For sciences like Newtonian\nmechanics we create experiments; others, like cosmology, are much harder to\nverify experimentally. Always, though, science is about creating predictive and\nresilient models.</p>\n<p>Noting that weather models are inherently complex and accurate over only short\nterms, Mr. Armstrong asks how much more complex climate models must be: how\ncould we know they&#39;re accurate? Well, models of larger phenomena smooth the\nsmaller systems. With non-linear feedback and turbulence, fluid dynamics is\nextremely complex. Predicting the waves would be impossible, right? Yet we have\nprecise and accurate tide charts far in advance. It&#39;s similar with climate and\nweather. Climate is driven by different inputs than weather; many trends can be\nmodeled. It&#39;s not easy; climate models are certainly complex. But it&#39;s not the\nimpossible task Dan Armstrong claims.</p>\n<p>Another letter suggests there&#39;s no true consensus because many scientists and\nscholars disagree. This is incorrect; there is a very strong consensus. That\ndoes not imply unanimity, but by most counts at least 97% of climate scientists\nagree that global temperature is rapidly rising, that humans are a substantial\ncause. Of 54,195 peer-reviewed papers studied between 1991 and 2015, only five\nrejected the consensus. And the agreement increases with climate expertise. The\nWikipedia article (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/agw-consensus\">http://bit.ly/agw-consensus</a>) links to relevant research.</p>\n"

(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/blinder-watson\">http://bit.ly/blinder-watson</a>)</p>\n<p>GDP growth averaged 2.54% under Republicans, 4.35% under Democrats.\nGrowth per capita is similar, as is growth across most industries.\nThe economy was in recession an average of 1.1 quarters during\nDemocratic terms and 4.6 quarters during Republican ones.</p>\n<p>Employment growth under Democrats averaged 2.59% and under\nRepublicans, 1.17%.  The unemployment rate for the Democrats averaged\n5.64% and for the Republicans 6.01%. (This was not statistically\nsignificant.)</p>\n<p>The S &amp; P 500 Index grew at an annual 2.70% rate under the GOP and at\n8.08% when a Democrat was in the White House.  Corporate profits grew\n5.62% during Democratic administrations and 4.74% during Republican\nones.</p>\n<p>Worker hourly productivity grew 2.55% and compensation at 1.81% during\nDemocratic years, but by 2.08% and 1.43%, respectively. during\nRepublican ones.

This is\nless hopeful to Republicans than it sounds, though, since rising\ninflation is a sign of high growth, falling inflation of low growth.</p>\n<p>There is little to explain these facts.  My point is not that\nDemocratic presidents are much better for the economy than are\nRepublicans.  I actually believe the president has little to do with\nyear-to-year economic performance.

A regulation-free\neconomy would allow the unscrupulous to provide slaves. It would allow\nchild labor.  It would allow lead paint in children&#39;s toys.  It could\nnot demand truthful advertising or require accurate ingredient labels.\nTo say that we would fix these flaws by law is already to distort free\nmarkets.</p>\n<p>Free markets provide many goods and services, but there are many\nothers they cannot provide.  How about public goods, such as courts,\nthe military, firefighters, police, roads?  There is no incentive for\nan individual to pay for them, so there is no incentive for someone to\nsell them.  Do free-market worshipers think we should just do without\nthem?</p>\n<p>And what about when economic exchanges adversely affects someone other\nthan the participants, known as &quot;negative externalities&quot;?  A free\nmarket offers little ways to prevent industrial pollution, to inhibit\noverfishing, to avoid antibiotic resistant pathogens.</p>\n<p>Free markets also face power imbalances.  How bad would cell service\nbe and how high would prices be in five years if Verizon bought all\nits major competitors today?  When the trust-busters broke up Standard\nOil or AT&amp;T, they were helping consumers, who had no power of their\nown.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest problem in free markets is that they recognize\nonly the value of money.  If something does not have a price, it is\nnot considered valuable.  Things such as ethical standards have no\nprice-point, so the free markets reject them.

His\nlatest lawyer claims that he can pardon himself: essentially the\npresident is so far above the law that he could &quot;stand in the middle\nof Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody&quot; and not face any consequences.\nPerhaps his lawyers read too many of his campaign speeches?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, our Constitution stands in his way.

I hate to see the lies stand, but as ridiculous as these letters\nare, it’s hard to imagine that anyone believes them, even their writers. So I\nwill take a hiatus for a while. Please keep in mind when reading letters that\nmake extraordinary claims that these require extraordinary evidence. There are a\nnumber of writers to this paper that don’t seem to know what evidence is.</p>\n<p>So pay attention to what these folks say. If, like <a href=\"#/person/Victor+Carli\">Victor Carli</a>, all they can do\nis misquote others, attempt to repudiate things no one has said, and promote\nviews no one who follows the news will believe, then they’re mostly harmless.\nIf, however, like <a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a>, they are actively attacking science, especially\nthat part which is trying to forestall the coming environmental disaster, then\nthey are dangerous. Those lies need to be challenged. I leave this in your\nhands.</p>\n"

In response to this news, he\npresented an incoherent conspiracy theory involving the FISA court,\nthe State Department, the DNC, and an opposition research firm, as\nwell as the Clintons, Barack Obama, John McCain, Christopher Steele,\nJames Comey, the Russian lawyer, an ambassador, and someone&#39;s in-laws.\nHe tosses all these together asking if we &quot;smell a rat.&quot;  I do, but I\nthink we disagree about the odor&#39;s origin.</p>\n<p>Such nonsense was once confined to the lunatic fringe.  It&#39;s\ndistressing to see just how wide that fringe has grown.</p>\n<p>Briefly, regarding <a href=\"#/person/Victor+Carli\">Victor Carli</a>: if his facts about the sun&#39;s massive\npower were the most relevant ones, then the Moon would be as warm as\nthe earth.  The difference?  Atmosphere.  And if he thinks science is\ndone by mathematical proof, then he knows nothing about science... or\nmath.  But then, we could have deduced that from his obsession with\none particular month when the temperature dropped: February, 2014 was\n.2 degrees cooler than the previous month, but still .41 degrees\nhigher than normal.

Third, journalism:\nreporters explain what is happening by cross-checking the claims of\none person with those of many others.</p>\n<p>Such processes use evidence to determine truth.  It should be obvious\nthat this is necessary, but some people act as though evidence doesn&#39;t\nmatter.</p>\n<p>Too many of them are in positions of influence and power: entertainers\npretending to be journalists such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and\nGlenn Beck, Congressional leaders such as Paul Ryan and Mitch\nMcConnell, and, of course, our so-called president.</p>\n<p>Other ones fill these pages with lies that barely try to masquerade as\ntruth.  <a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice\">Sam Prentice</a> mixes irrelevant truths with very relevant\nfalsehoods and ignores the scientific evidence of global warming.\n<a href=\"#/person/Victor+Carli\">Victor Carli</a> goes further, inventing quotations that misstate others&#39;\nopinions, &quot;correcting&quot; truthful letters by presenting easily checked\nlies, confusing disdain for an officeholder with contempt for the\noffice, and, in an extremely muddled bit of thinking, claiming that\nacting as an &quot;Unamerican Activist&quot; is an attempt to resurrect\nMcCarthyism.  (That would be very funny except that he actually seems\nto mean it.)</p>\n<p>People like this devalue truth itself.  When they reject science by\naccepting proclamations over repeatable experiments, when they reject\njustice by demeaning the judges who serve it, when they reject\njournalism by treating hot-headed loudmouths as superior to\nexperienced professionals, they are demeaning all of us.</p>\n<p>When your ideology interferes with the search for truth, it is not the\nworld that is at fault.

The portion returned to space has been decreasing\nbecause our atmosphere absorbs more energy.</p>\n<p>The strong scientific consensus is that this is caused by human-generated gasses\nin the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. Mr. Carli presents no disputes to\nthis and he brings up irrelevancies. He discusses mathematical proof. Absurd:\nscience is never about that. And he mentions a temperature drop from January,\n2014 to February, 2014 as though that were evidence against global warming. It&#39;s\neasy to see how tiny an anomaly this is at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps\">http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps</a>.</p>\n<p>In short, humans are causing our land, oceans, and atmosphere to heat rapidly.\nThere is no scientific controversy over this. Yet fossil-fuel industry funded\nresearchers muddy the waters. Conservatives, threatened by changes to their\nbusiness models, buy into such crackpot theories.</p>\n<p>Previously, when we&#39;ve had ecological problems, people came together to address\nthem. Note that we hear little now about acid rain or the ozone hole. We came\ntogether to solve such problems that litter has decreased in this generation.\nNote that toxic waterways have been cleaned.

      <h1>About this Site</h1>
      <p>
          I am one of those gadflies who writes often to the local weekly paper.
          I've been doing it for years.  This page collects those letters for posterity.
      </p>
      <p id="currentLetter"></p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions.
        That comes through in those letters.  I have covered topics such as 
        <a href="#/tag/Global+Warming">Global Warming</a>, the ideas of 
        <a href="#/tag/Progressivism">Progressivism</a>, 
        <a href="#/tag/Fact+Checking">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of 
        <a href="#/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a>, as well as 
        <a href="#/tags/">many others</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please
        remember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very
        important, the local ones, the national ones and the global ones. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have in the past served in the local government of Andover, Connecticut
        (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning Commission,
        the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town Committee), all of
        the letters here represent my own views and not those of these organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,
        not the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>.  The dates are the dates I 
        wrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A few were never 
        published, and I never did try to determine why.  There may have been mild
        editing by the <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don't exactly match what was 
        published, but that's rare, and it never changes the meaning.
      </p>
      <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:scott@sauyet.com">email me</a> with
        any comments or suggestions.
