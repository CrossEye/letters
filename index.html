      <h1>Scott Sauyet's <em>Rivereast</em> Letters to the Editor</h1>
      <p>
          I am one of those gadflies who writes often to the local weekly paper.
          I've been doing it for years.  This page will collect those letters for posterity.
      </p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions.
        That comes through in those letters.  I have covered topics such as 
        <a href="#/tag/Global+Warming">Global Warming</a>, the ideas of 
        <a href="#/tag/Progressivism">Progressivism</a>, 
        <a href="#/tag/Fact+Checking">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of 
        <a href="#/tag/Donald+Trump">Donald Trump</a>, as well as 
        <a href="#/tags/">many others</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please
        remember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very
        important, the local ones, the national ones and the global ones. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I have in the past served in Andover, Connecticut's local government
        (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning Commission,
        the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town Committee), all of
        the letters here represent my own views and not those of these organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,
        not the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>>.  The dates are the dates I 
        wrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A few were never 
        published, although I never did try to determine why.  There may have been mild
        editing by the <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don't exactly match what was 
        published, but that's rare, and it never changes the meaning.
