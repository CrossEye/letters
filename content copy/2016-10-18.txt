I've been confusing lucidity with intellectual depth. Often, when disagreeing
with Sam Prentice, I've favorably compared him to certain other conservative
letter writers. My head was turned by the fact that unlike too many of his
brethren, he is actually articulate, and I simply ignored the gaps in his logic.

His most recent letter, though, is rather stunning. Earlier, he'd critiqued the
financial management of the Clinton Foundation. This attack had been making the
rounds in conservative media; it's not surprising to see it repeated here. But
when the following week Dick Schroth responded with the actual facts, Mr.
Prentice attacked the messenger, doubling down on his misinformation.

One would think that when challenged so, Mr. Prentice might bother to check the
facts. Instead, he simply invoked The Daily Caller. (This is a conservative
political website; it may want to think of itself as competing with The New York
Times, but really it's just a right-wing version of The Huffington Post.)
Whether it's from the Daily Caller or his own head, Sam Prentice's information
is bogus.

For the truth of the matter, one can search for "Clinton Foundation" on the
political fact-checking sites, such as FactCheck.org, PolitiFact.com or the
Washington Post Fact Check. These non-partisan sites all give the same
information: It is a healthy, A-rated foundation, spending 88% of its money on
charitable programs. That only 6% is given in grants is meaningless, since this
is not primarily a grant-giving organization, but one that operates its own
projects. Actually, the Clinton Foundation receives grants from other charities
in order to do its work.

Next time, it's best to check the facts before posting them the first time. But
it's intellectually dishonest to attack someone's corrections without doing some
actual research first. Don't make truth a casualty of your ideology.
