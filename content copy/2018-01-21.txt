Sam Prentice again promotes false Republican talking points, claiming
Dick Durbin lied about Donald Trump's words.  Dick Durbin reported
what he heard.  Few doubt that our so-called president used vulgar
terminology.  (That officials claimed it was "shithouse", not
"shithole", changes nothing.)

Mr. Prentice reiterates Senator Cotton's claims that Senator Durbin
once accused a Republican of being disrespectful to President Obama.
He did make that accusation, based on what Jay Carney later explained
was a White House "miscommunication"  Fact-checkers have already
debunked Senator Cotton's allegation, rating it "Misleading".

Worse, Mr. Prentice misrepresents a torture debate, saying, "Durbin
compared our military to Nazis, Stalin's gulags, and Pol Pot".
Senator Durbin actually said: "If I read this to you and did not tell
you that it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to
prisoners in their control, you would most certainly believe this must
have been done by Nazis, Soviets in their gulags or some mad regime -
Pol Pot or others - that had no concern for human beings."  It's hard
to argue with that.

Sam Prentice's conspiracy theory claims Democrats are trying to woo
back African Americans.  He repeats Mr. Trump's claim that his African
American support doubled.  But Donald Trump lies constantly.  If he
tweets that two plus two is four, it's worth double-checking.  Mr.
Trump's approval rating among African Americans actually fell
significantly last year; it's easy to look up.  That Breitbart and
Trump said otherwise should not be confused with evidence.  African
American unemployment is quite low; little credit is due Donald Trump.
It fell 8.6 percentage points in the preceding five years, and 1.2
points last year -- all before Donald Trump's first budget.
Applauding him is sophistry.

Sam Prentice is entitled to his opinions, but, as John Adams said,
"Facts are stubborn things."
