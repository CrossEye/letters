Sam Prentice is correct that the Left's reaction to Steve Bannon is more
reflexive than thoughtful.

This does not imply the reaction is wrong. A propagandist filmmaker, heir to
Nazi favorite Leni Riefenstahl, inspires little confidence. What would the Right
think of a President putting Michael Moore in a position of influence?

Worse is Steve Bannon's turn at the helm of Breitbart News. Breitbart was never
loved by the Left but once Mr. Bannon took charge it became a cesspool of
offensiveness. The alt-right simply rebrands ideas we'd hoped were outgrown:
virulent anti-Semitism, brutal racism, nasty misogyny, and a xenophobic
anti-immigrant stance at odds with American history and values. While it's
difficult to discern Mr. Bannon's personal feelings on these issues, the culture
he fostered is simply barbarous.

Mr. Prentice challenges the Left's rejection of Mr. Bannon and Donald Trump as
hypocritical. He suggests we're ignoring our own emphasis on universally
increasing prosperity. First, it's been impossible to discern actual policy
positions from the Trump campaign or its aftermath.. More importantly, when you
choose with whom you will ally, you must choose holistically, not on a
particular stance. Perhaps the jury is still out on Mr. Bannon, and perhaps not,
but the entire campaign of hatred has shown Donald Trump to be someone with whom
the Left has too little in common.

Donald Trump is offensive in the extreme, the greatest danger to our Republic
since the Civil War. Of course we're going to oppose him.
