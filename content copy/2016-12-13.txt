Remember how ridiculously easy it was rebutting letters from our
bamboozled correspondent?  It's heading that way with Sam Prentice.
His latest screed contains so many errors I can only rebut a few here.

First, when I point out that Steve Bannon had changed the tone of
Breitbart News after taking over from its founder -- and that the new
tone was offensive, virulently anti-Semitism -- Mr. Prentice attempts
to deny it, explaining that the founder was Jewish.  Yes, we get that;
does Sam Prentice understand that dead founders have less say in
day-to-day operations than live managers, especially those known to
bully their staff?  For an example of Mr. Bannon's tenure at
Breitbart, one can Google "Renegade Jew".

Then he promotes misinformation about the election, mentioning Donald
Trump's "massive win".  There was no massive win.  Mr. Trump lost the
national vote by nearly 3 million.  His presumed electoral college
margin is 306-232, 46th place in our 58 elections.  His popular vote
percentage is 43rd out of the 49 elections since records were kept.
Then he counts the states, and even more absurdly, the counties won by
each candidate.  Neither means anything to our Constitution, in which
voters choose electors and electors choose the president.

Then there's the illogical claim that Secretary Clinton's popular vote
win "relies solely on California."  Can we say also that Donald
Trump's electoral college advantage relies solely on Texas and
Florida?  Sam Prentice continues, repeating the well-debunked lie that
illegal aliens are automatically registered when they obtain driver
licenses.

Mr. Prentice, it's not nice to your neighbors that you leave all your
fact-checking to others.  It's not hard to do.  There are plenty of
reliable sources.  Do you find it so hard to recognize the truth?  Or
do you just not care?
