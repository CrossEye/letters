Sam Prentice presents his view of the minimum wage, condescending to his fellow
citizens in doing so.

His theory is that a rise in the minimum wage would increase inflation and
decrease employment. He has a reasonable explanation of why he thinks so. But he
presents no evidence.

There is a good reason for this. The evidence all contradicts his theory. The
best study of these issues was done by Dube, Lester, and Reich in 2010
(http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA). This is a technical paper and not particularly easy to
read, but anyone who's taken a statistics course and is not afraid of Greek
letters should be able to follow it. An easier-to-read summarization of the
research from the past fifteen years was done by John Schmitt in 2013
(http://bit.ly/1eWItVi). The author's analysis is colored by his liberal
political ideology. Nonetheless, it is a comprehensive overview of the recent
literature; the summarizations are straightforward and apolitical.

The results of these studies is conclusive: the published work, taken together,
"revealed no statistically significant negative employment effects of the
minimum wage." Nor did minimum wage hikes substantially change wages higher up
the pay scale.

There is somewhat less evidence about inflation. The most-cited study seems to
be an overview by Lemos in 2004 (http://bit.ly/1HfLM4W). This one is fairly
readable, and not at all math-heavy. It is a survey and critique of the
available literature and an analysis of the published data. It makes a simple
conclusion: a 10% hike in the minimum wage would not have a large impact on
inflation, adding not more than 0.4 points to the inflation rate.

Theories without evidence are merely ideology. Evidence is what points us toward
the truth. The evidence says there is minimal harm and substantial good to be
had by increasing the minimum wage.
