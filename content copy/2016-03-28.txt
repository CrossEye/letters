Joe Stevens aptly describes the problematic symptoms presented by Daniel Colby's
letter, but his diagnosis is mistaken. There is an empathy problem with the
loud-mouthed leadership speaking for the Right, but this is not an issue for
most everyday conservatives. No, what Mr. Colby's letter displays is a
fundamental lack of understanding of our government, the role of government in
society, and our modern political world.

Mr. Colby describes libertarianism and calls it conservatism. He describes
authoritarianism and calls it liberalism. The latter is especially strange since
this election features at least one authoritarian candidate trying to pass as
conservative. This ignorance of the basics of political philosophy is
understandable, but not really excusable. Those who listen only to the
self-reinforcing echo chamber of Fox News without applying critical thinking can
end up buying such nonsense.

It's not just politics at issue; it's the very nature of government. Daniel
Colby longs for the days when, "People used to look to one another, their
communities, they were the first resource, not the government," making the
absurd assumption that government is something external, not part of our
community, that it's other, alien. But government is not an external force
imposed on an unwary citizenry. It's simply an instrument of the people.

His contention that the Left believes in limitless government is equally absurd.
The Left has a very long history of removing restrictive laws; the Left is very
strong on individual liberties. If we want to discuss authoritarianism, by all
means let's do so, but don't call it liberalism; that's something very
different.

For much of our history, political absurdities appeared equally often on the
Left and the Right. But somewhere in this generation, the Right has gone off the
deep end. Uninformed letters like Mr. Colby's just cheer on the madness.
