Remember the playground taunt, "I know you are, but what am I?" It meant: "I'm
not smart enough to make a clever response, but I know you're disparaging me, so
I'll just echo it back." It was a poor retort, a weak, whining, walk-away shot.

Since 2017, we've heard how Donald Trump and allies will try to steal this
election. A barrage of accounts report voter suppression efforts. For decades
Republicans have been barred from mounting poll-watching campaigns, because it's
always attempts to deter minority voting. The ban lifted, and they're starting
back up. The intelligence community warns that Russia is at it again. In the
Covid era, when states expanded vote-by-mail options, Trump's flunky sabotaged
our mail delivery system. When Biden called them out, the fact-checkers said,
"Hold on! You don't have any evidence." Then Trump -- with a penchant for saying
the quiet things out loud -- publicly confessed, and they said, "Never mind.
Biden was right." (http://bit.ly/mail-fiddle)

Trump and the remaining GOP fragments are putting their thumbs on the scale. How
do they respond to critics? Trump repeatedly asserts long-debunked claims that
mail-in ballots are fraudulent, that millions of non-citizens vote, that China
is trying to hack the election toward Biden.

Sam Prentice follows the same theme, He casts minor distinctions in mailed
ballots categories as major fault lines. He radically misstates Federal law
about voter roll purging. (Federal law does not mandate it, instead offering
significant restrictions on state processes.) He warns about substantial voter
fraud, a non-issue according to experts. He says, "Democrats don't just want to
win by cheating. They're seeking to discredit the entire electoral process so
results won't be seen as legitimate."

Do you hear it? An echo of the school playground? They're whining "I know you
are, but what am I?"
