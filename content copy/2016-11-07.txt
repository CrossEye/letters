Sam Prentice wants a gold star for conducting his own research, denigrating
those who consult experts instead. He is sticking to his completely debunked
story on the charitable status of the Clinton Foundation. I'm glad he thinks
he's an expert in the tax filings of public charities. Personally, I'm glad to
listen to those who actually know what they're talking about. Unfortunately,
that does not include Mr. Prentice.

He reaches the exact same wrong conclusions as early reports on right-wing
media, conclusions already discredited by professional fact-checkers and charity
watchers. (And his is independent research?) Applying his techniques to the 990
filings from Amnesty International, Oxfam, and the Red Cross, would show that
these also must be horrible frauds, awarding grants totaling only 25.7%, 29.5%
and 3.98% of their budgets, respectively. This should help demonstrate that his
methods are wrong.

The trouble, as Mr. Prentice has already been informed, is that the Clinton
Foundation is more like these organizations, running its own programs, not
making grants like the Carnegie Foundation. So, on that 990 form, line 10, he
needs to divide line 25(B) by line 25(A) to determine the portion of the
foundation's spending that went to charitable work. 25(C) and 25(D) represent
management overhead and fund-raising. Note that Charity Navigator and Charity
Watch give the Clinton Foundation top marks.

The bigger issue is that Sam Prentice and his peers can stick to such balderdash
in the face of the clear evidence that it's fallacious. Something has gone quite
wrong when people let their ideology overshadow the truth. This is not limited
to the right-wing, but it seems much more prominent there, starting with the
likes of Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich, and leading eventually to the most
preposterous candidate for president any major party has ever nominated.
