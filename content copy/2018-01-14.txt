It's sad to watch an institution in sharp decline.  The party of
Lincoln, of Teddy Roosevelt, the Republicans were once a party with a
soul.

That party has died.

I read the testimony of Glenn Simpson about Fusion GPS and Christopher
Steele.  Grilled for hours, he gave clear, consistent, and helpful
answers.  He claimed privilege often but he had plenty to say.  He
testified about attacks on our elections.

The Republicans asked him no questions about this.

None.

Instead, they attacked the messenger, trying to trip him up about
irrelevancies.  The party that acts like this has lost its soul.

The best description comes from an anonymous Twitter account: "It was
an agonizing tour of the descent of the Republican Party into
something that isn't even partisan... that isn't self-serving. It's
political sociopathy."

It's even worse than that.  By shielding our so-called president from
the consequences of his vituperation, pettiness, and lies, they are
sinking the United States into an abyss.  Our international reputation
is decimated, our influence in tatters.  The Republican Party puts
partisanship ahead of truth, ahead of honor, ahead of country.  It is
treason, pure and simple.

It's sad to watch the GOP in such sharp decline.
