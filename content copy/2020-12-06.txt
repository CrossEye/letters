Misquoting Biden and quoting him out of context (see the usual fact-checkers),
Sam Prentice asserts monstrous election fraud. He presents no evidence and it's
obvious why: because there is none. Conspiracy theories postulate a grand cabal
out to deny Trump a second term: Republicans and Democrats, governors,
legislators, election officials, postal workers, voting machine makers, polling
workers, and, I'm guessing, Santa's elves. But I'll let you in on a little
secret. There actually is a large group trying to oust Trump: the American
people. Sorry about that.

It's not only that there's no evidence. The Trump campaign has repeatedly
litigated these claims in court. His results: 1 win, 46 losses. Someone call
Guinness Book: has any plaintiff lost so many cases in one month?

Speaking of one month, in 2016, fans here credited Trump for the post-election
stock market bump. It was impressive, a one-month jump of 7.01% in. I'm
wondering, do those same people credit Biden for the rise of 9.03% this past
month?

Anyway, absent any evidence, those peddling huge election fraud are simply
conspiracy theorists. As heard recently, "Don't laugh at kids for believing in
Santa Claus; some adults believe Trump won the election."
