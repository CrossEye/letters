    "Content": "<p><a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice/\">Sam Prentice</a> says that I &quot;unintentionally rail against meritocracy.&quot;  Do you\nbelieve him?  The letter he was presumably responding to is at\n<a href=\"http://letters.sauyet.com/#/2021-11-05/\">http://letters.sauyet.com/#/2021-11-05/</a>.  Go ahead and read it; I&#39;ll wait...</p>\n<p>No?  You found no sign of railing about anything, perhaps?  No critique of\nmeritocracy?  Don&#39;t be surprised.  This is Mr. Prentice&#39;s <em>modus operandi</em>:\ninvent a straw man, fail to knock down even that, then hope no one will notice\nhis sleight of hand.</p>\n<p>&quot;People,&quot; he says, &quot;who see everything through the prism of skin color are the\ntrue racists.&quot;  Could be.  Do you know anyone like that?  I certainly don&#39;t.\nBut we&#39;ve all met those who deny that current and past racism are significant\ncauses of modern inequalities.  It sounds as though Mr. Prentice is treading\nclose to that line.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the same day I read Mr. Prentice&#39;s note on meritocracy, I\nhappened upon an academic paper (<a href=\"https://link.sauyet.com/34\">https://link.sauyet.com/34</a>) which showed that\namong White students admitted to Harvard, 43% are admitted note not because of\nacademic merit but because they are athletes or the children of alumni, staff,\nor donors.  For non-White students, that number is no more than 16%.  Many\ndoors are opened by degrees from a prestigious university, so this is one more\nexample of how structural racism perpetuates racial inequality.  The world is\nfull of such examples.  Noting and reporting them is not racism.  Denying them\noften is.</p>\n<p>Finally, we should note the odd obsession of Sam Prentice and other\nconservatives with the Democratic party.  Sixty-plus years ago, the parties\nswapped places in their approach to race; today the vast majority of\nAfrican-Americans find the Democratic party the more congenial home.  As a\nprogressive, I simply prefer the parties with progressive agendas and remain\nunconcerned about what they stood for a hundred years ago.</p>\n"

As Paul has no relevant credentials and has\nbeen publicly feuding with Fauci, he&#39;s not a credible source, but let&#39;s follow\nfurther:</p>\n<p>Paul merely retweets Richard H.

In\nfact, it says the exact opposite. I have no idea why Ebright misrepresents this,\nbut Rand Paul and Gary Gile seizing upon it as evidence only demonstrates\npeople&#39;s inability or unwillingness to read.</p>\n<p>The next link points to a news aggregator reposting material from The Washington\nExaminer. This right-wing site has a credibility problem\n(<a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/</a>.) But the biggest issue is\nthat this is an <em>opinion</em> piece, not a news article. It&#39;s not evidence for\nanything, except perhaps ineptness in citing.</p>\n<p>Next, we visit a random YouTuber breathlessly trying to debunk something and\nconfusing rainstorms with global wind patterns. Then an opinion piece from\nMurdoch&#39;s Sky News (again untrustworthy:\n<a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news-australia/\">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/sky-news-australia/</a>), preaching to some other\nchoir; I see little sign in it of Biden&#39;s faculties declining.

It&#39;s the simple notion that racism is structural, not merely\nindividual. This is so obvious that only the most ideologically blinded\nreactionaries could deny it. Have you heard of slavery? Of Jim Crow? Of\nlynchings? Of red-lining? Of racial sentencing disparities? To deny CRT is to\ndeny these had to do with race.</p>\n<p>Certain brain-dead state legislatures are reacting to Fox&#39;s propaganda,\nrestricting what may be taught, going as far as prohibiting lessons that might\nmake students &quot;feel discomfort, guilt, or anguish&quot; because of their race or sex.\nTalk about cancel culture!

He had\ndescribed some serious concerns and presented actual facts. Last week he\nreturned to true form and shared a laundry list of falsehoods and\nconspiracy-minded nonsense.</p>\n<p>He structured his complaints as a review of the first months of President\nBiden&#39;s term, but talked about trends continuing from the previous\nadministration: think murder rate, illegal immigration, gas prices, and\nespecially the Covid pandemic. (More details at FactCheck:\n<a href=\"http://link.sauyet.com/29\">http://link.sauyet.com/29</a>.)</p>\n<p>Most egregious was his Covid take. First, &quot;so-called pandemic&quot;? How can he\nsuggest this has been anything but a pandemic with over 219 million cases\nworldwide and 4.5 million deaths? He makes some crack about the recent flu\nseason. It was far lower than normal for the simple and obvious reason that the\nflu is transmitted by the same mechanisms as Covid so all the Covid-prevention\nmeasures helped prevent the flu.</p>\n<p>Worst, though was his claim that Covid is no more deadly than the yearly flu.\nHow can you credit anything said by someone claiming such obvious balderdash? An\naverage flu season in the US claims around 36,000 lives. Covid in the last\neighteen months has claimed over 660,000. It seems to have an infection fatality\nrate ten to twenty times greater than the flu. These are not hard facts to find.</p>\n<p>Second, <a href=\"#/person/Ed+Smith/\">Edmund Smith</a> overstates his case regarding the origins of Christian\nbeliefs. Certainly, scholars can find antecedents for nearly every facet of the\nreligion. A few, like Christmas/Saturnalia and the English name for Easter are\nwell documented. The rest is at best well-grounded speculation. For someone who\nchides people for not understanding science and its methods, his letters are a\nlittle too cavalier in their confident historical claims about ancient events\nwithout any contemporaneous documentation.</p>\n"

Science does not take a stand on theism versus atheism. Science is\nabout statements we could prove false; it&#39;s impossible to falsify anything said\nabout omnipotent beings who might wish to hide their tracks... although Occam&#39;s\nRazor does apply.</p>\n<p>Science covers theories and the evidence to support them. Buddhists, Christians,\nHindus, Muslims, and others don&#39;t generally try to present evidence for their\nbeliefs. Nor do they often attempt to convince others of their own beliefs. When\nthey do it&#39;s usually circular reasoning (God is great because it says so in\nscripture, and the scripture is right because it&#39;s the word of God) or sophism\nlike Pascal&#39;s Wager or the First Cause, nonsense scientists feel little need to\nrebut.</p>\n<p>The issues theists discuss overlap little with those of science.

(Technically I do, but\nwith no antenna or cable, it&#39;s just a device for playing DVDs, streaming\nNetflix, etc.) I get my news from newspapers, magazines, radio, and the\nInternet. What I learned from these sources was that this was the most\nwidespread protest movement in US history; that the movement was a sincere\nattempt to change a culture of police brutality, especially towards black men;\nthat there were numerous incidents of violence, looting, and burning; that a\nfrightening amount of the violence was perpetrated by the police on unarmed\nprotesters; that another significant portion of it was created by\ncounter-protesters; that the total property damage was high; that the former guy\nin the White House and allies tried to spin this as an anarchist, violent\nmovement; that perhaps six percent of the events had any associated violence or\nproperty damage.</p>\n<p>There were around forty protests in Connecticut during this time. The only\nincident of violence I recall was when a car drove into the crowd of protesters\nand some protesters confronted the driver about it. Of course we saw the\nviolence across the country, and of course there was a lot of it, but it\ninvolved a small fraction of the overall movement.</p>\n"

The pendulum currently\nfavors property. (See Heather Cox Richardson&#39;s <em>To Make Men Free</em> for details.)\nCurrently there is more room for liberal ideas in the Democratic Party, so\nthat&#39;s where we&#39;ve been most active.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m afraid there has been a change over the last few decades, especially over\nthe last four years. The Republican party has enabled the misbehavior of the\nmost corrupt, most incompetent, and, I&#39;m willing to say, the most evil president\nour country has ever seen.</p>\n<p>Our answer is simple. We are going to have to adopt some partisanship. For the\nnext few years, we are going to refuse to vote for <em>any</em> Republican who does not\npublicly and loudly disavow Donald Trump and all he stands for. Not for\nPresident. Not for Senator, Governor, School Board, or Dogcatcher. We&#39;re not\nalone. The Lincoln Project, the Bulwark, Republican Voters Against Trump, and\nothers show that this is still not coming from a narrow ideological group. This\nis widespread disgust.</p>\n<p>Republican candidates, please be on notice. We have not before been particularly\npartisan. But Trump has pushed us that way.

I just read\nOreskes and Conway&#39;s <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>, and I highly recommend it (or the\ndocumentary based on it.) It describes how since the 1950s there has been a\ncoordinated effort to discredit inconvenient science, how an overlapping cast of\ncharacters has been involved in denying that tobacco causes lung cancer, that\nReagan&#39;s Star Wars idea was infeasible, that power company emissions cause acid\nrain, that CFCs cause the ozone hole, that second-hand smoke is dangerous, and\nthat burning fossil fuels causes global warming.</p>\n<p>This process started with the tobacco companies. Because they had no reasonable\nway to attack the science heads-on, they formed an array of pseudo-independent\norganizations meant only to sow doubt about the science. They managed to\nconvince journalists to cover this as though there was actual scientific\ncontroversy. They kept this up forty years, selling many more cigarettes along\nthe way.</p>\n<p>This worked so well that although scientists made it clear that Reagan&#39;s Star\nWars wasn&#39;t possible, a small group used the tobacco play-book to attack the\nscience detailing nuclear winter. The same people then promoted acid rain\ndenial, ozone obfuscation, and the current project of denying global warming.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, the science is clear. But former cold warriors like Fred\nSinger, Robert Jastrow, Fred Leitz, and Bill Nierenberg made a career of\nmuddying the waters, trying to make us believe the answers are not\nwell-established. They found gullible journalists and bystanders to promote\ntheir fantasies. The book makes a credible case that the motivation of such\nonce-prominent scientists is that they believe they&#39;re still fighting Communism,\nthat regulations yield a slippery slope towards socialism.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s well worth a read.</p>\n"

I&#39;ve tried determining his\ncredentials: if the blogs are correct, his advanced degrees are in Engineering\nand his specialty is aeronautics/astronautics, not climatology.  The only\narticles I found were two Google Docs from 2009 (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/weinstein-1\">http://bit.ly/weinstein-1</a> and\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/weintstein-2\">http://bit.ly/weintstein-2</a>).  They are not peer-reviewed, discuss only\natmospheric heat, and try to debunk statements never published.  But the biggest\nissue I see is that his projections assume the entire 20th century&#39;s output of\nCO2 acreted linearly.  When you factor in the accelerating rate, his results are\nmeaningless.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m sure Mr. Armstrong can add additional names; most would likely be similar,\neither non-experts chiming in or experts saying something different than the\ncontrarians claim.  There are legitimate climate scientists who disagree with\nthe consensus; that&#39;s how science works. However most climate skeptics are\ncoming at it backward: &quot;it will be difficult to react to climate change, so\nlet&#39;s fund a study to pretend it&#39;s not happening.&quot;</p>\n<p>What bothers me about the climate skeptic community is not the obvious\nconspiracy theory mentality; that&#39;s no longer noteworthy.  It&#39;s not the\nscientific illiteracy; that&#39;s regrettable but understood.  What bothers me is\nthe smugness of a group that thinks it has inside information everyone else is\ntoo brainwashed to recognize.  I remember during high school in the 1980s when\neveryone who wanted to demonstrate their individual non-conformity sported a\nMohawk -- everyone.  This is the same.</p>\n<p>Yes, it&#39;s true that scientific consensus is occasionally overthrown; sometimes\nan Einstein or a Darwin comes along to shake things up.

Reid, and Petr Chýlek.</p>\n<p>Robert Laughlin says the earth doesn&#39;t care and will outlast any problems we\ncreate.  Dr. Laughlin is another scientist weighing in where he has no\nexpertise, but the main point of his most famous article\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/earth-knows\">http://bit.ly/earth-knows</a>) is that the earth has suffered great catastrophes\nbefore and survived.  I&#39;m afraid I root for humanity and don&#39;t have his\ndispassionate approach.  While he disputes the strength of the consensus\nopinion, he does accept it.</p>\n<p>Judith Curry, by contrast, has impeccable climatology credentials and a position\nof leadership in the field.  If she were raising questions about the reality of\nanthropogenic global warming (AGW), it would be interesting news.  Instead, her\nmost quoted article (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/curry-on-credibility\">http://bit.ly/curry-on-credibility</a>) simply objects to the\nscience community&#39;s political handling of climate controversy, an important\npoint certainly, but not relevant to the reality of AGW.</p>\n<p>For John T Reid, I find skeptical blog posts and industry articles but no\nacademic qualifications or peer-reviewed articles.  Are there reliable\nreferences?</p>\n<p>I couldn&#39;t find the Petr Chýlek article quoted (&quot;Hiatus: Existence, Causes, and\nFuture Temperature Projections&quot;.)  But I read some of his work, and it&#39;s within\nthe consensus formulation, questioning only the degree of AGW.  He explains &quot;The\nHiatus&quot;, a decade where surface air temperature stopped growing.  This is\nimportant, given how skeptics emphasize this pause: only a bit more than 2% of\nthe total heat in the system is in the atmosphere.  Over 93% is in the oceans.\nWhen atmospheric heat stopped rising, ocean heat didn&#39;t pause and global\ntemperatures continued their rapid rise.</p>\n<p>(Next week: Leonard Weinstein and conclusions on scientific consensus.)</p>\n"

The first (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/clouds-warm\">http://bit.ly/clouds-warm</a>), from\nFinland&#39;s Turku University claims climate models ignore the effect of cloud\ncoverage.  This paper is not peer-reviewed, citing few sources beyond the\nauthors&#39; own (often unpublished) research.  They don&#39;t explain their data or\nmethods. Essentially they note a correlation, then assert without evidence that\ncloud cover causes warming rather than the reverse.  A professional rebuttal is\nat  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/warm-clouds\">http://bit.ly/warm-clouds</a>.</p>\n<p>The second (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/svenmark\">http://bit.ly/svenmark</a>) seems a legitimate paper, but I couldn&#39;t\nfollow it entirely (I&#39;m Scientific American-level science literate, not\nNature-level!)  What I did gather is that Earth&#39;s periodic magnetic field\nreversal correlates to the glacial cycle.  I see little here contradicting\nanthropogenic global warming; perhaps someone better at climatology can\nenlighten me.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong also quotes scientists. Ivar Giaever said, &quot;Global warming has\nbecome a new religion.&quot;  Yes, there are skeptics.  In a world that appreciates\ncuriosity and freedom of expression, there always will be.</p>\n<p>But if you heard that Joe Torre criticized the way Bill Belicheck arranged his\nplays, you would listen politely; his obvious expertise coaching baseball\naffords him some respect.  But he&#39;s not a football coach; we cannot assume his\nexpertise transfers.   Dr. Giaever is a Nobel-prize winning physicist; we should\nlisten respectfully to his scientific comments.  But a retired professor of\nphysics is not a likely contributor to climatology.  Moreover, his affiliation\nwith the anti-science Heartland Institute makes his pronouncements questionable.\nThis think tank plainly lets ideology and funding drive its science, rejecting\nthe tobacco/cancer link and fighting the global warming consensus.  Listen\npolitely to Dr. Giaever, but don&#39;t count on his understanding or objectivity.</p>\n<p>This goes double for mathematician David Evans and retired chemist Les Woodcock.</p>\n<p>(Next week: more scientists.)</p>\n"

I planned\na parody letter, listing professors rejecting evolution or promoting flat-earth\ntheories. It could have been amusing. But instead, over a few letters I will\ndiscuss the scientists Mr. Armstrong has presented. First, a few words about\nscience.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong says, &quot;Predicting future events based on past events is not\nexperimentally proven science; it is statistical forecasting.&quot; No, creating\nprediction models is exactly what science does, combining past events and\ntheoretical understanding in varying proportions. For sciences like Newtonian\nmechanics we create experiments; others, like cosmology, are much harder to\nverify experimentally. Always, though, science is about creating predictive and\nresilient models.</p>\n<p>Noting that weather models are inherently complex and accurate over only short\nterms, Mr. Armstrong asks how much more complex climate models must be: how\ncould we know they&#39;re accurate? Well, models of larger phenomena smooth the\nsmaller systems. With non-linear feedback and turbulence, fluid dynamics is\nextremely complex. Predicting the waves would be impossible, right? Yet we have\nprecise and accurate tide charts far in advance. It&#39;s similar with climate and\nweather. Climate is driven by different inputs than weather; many trends can be\nmodeled. It&#39;s not easy; climate models are certainly complex. But it&#39;s not the\nimpossible task Dan Armstrong claims.</p>\n<p>Another letter suggests there&#39;s no true consensus because many scientists and\nscholars disagree. This is incorrect; there is a very strong consensus. That\ndoes not imply unanimity, but by most counts at least 97% of climate scientists\nagree that global temperature is rapidly rising, that humans are a substantial\ncause. Of 54,195 peer-reviewed papers studied between 1991 and 2015, only five\nrejected the consensus. And the agreement increases with climate expertise. The\nWikipedia article (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/agw-consensus\">http://bit.ly/agw-consensus</a>) links to relevant research.</p>\n"

Why should I pay for the military or\npolice  when my house has never been burgled and my town never been invaded?\nOnly those who choose these services should have to pay for them.&quot;  In\nprinciple, this is no different from someone declaring that environmental\nprotection or education is not an essential government function.</p>\n<p>The libertarian credo is just camouflage for the claim that only one set of\npriorities is actually important and anyone with a different set is a taker.\nThat is not how democracy works.</p>\n"

This is a somewhat boring\nfollow-up to that, backing it up with numbers showing these partisan differences\nfrom 1948 through 2012.  This information is in Blinder and Watson&#39;s 2014 paper.\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/blinder-watson\">http://bit.ly/blinder-watson</a>)</p>\n<p>GDP growth averaged 2.54% under Republicans, 4.35% under Democrats. Growth per\ncapita is similar, as is growth across most industries. The economy was in\nrecession an average of 1.1 quarters during Democratic terms and 4.6 quarters\nduring Republican ones.</p>\n<p>Employment growth under Democrats averaged 2.59% and under Republicans, 1.17%.\nThe unemployment rate for the Democrats averaged 5.64% and for the Republicans\n6.01%. (This was not statistically significant.)</p>\n<p>The S &amp; P 500 Index grew at an annual 2.70% rate under the GOP and at 8.08% when\na Democrat was in the White House.  Corporate profits grew 5.62% during\nDemocratic administrations and 4.74% during Republican ones.</p>\n<p>Worker hourly productivity grew 2.55% and compensation at 1.81% during\nDemocratic years, but by 2.08% and 1.43%, respectively. during Republican ones.\nBudget deficit averaged 1.5% of GDP for Democrats and 2.2% for Republicans.</p>\n<p>The inflation rate was 2.97% for Democrats and 3.2% for Republicans; it rose an\naverage of 1.05 percentage points over a Democratic term and fell an average of\n0.83 points during a Republican one.  This is less hopeful to Republicans than\nit sounds, though, since rising inflation is a sign of high growth, falling\ninflation of low growth.</p>\n<p>There is little to explain these facts.  My point is not that Democratic\npresidents are much better for the economy than are Republicans.  I actually\nbelieve the president has little to do with year-to-year economic performance.\nBut some seem to think that Republican are much better for the economy.  They\nare wrong, pure and simple.</p>\n"

Sam\nPrentice claims that my conclusions must be wrong because they don&#39;t match his\ntheory.  Science is done differently.

The first (Jardim, et. al.,\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo\">http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo</a>), using new methodologies which are credible but not yet\nwidely recognized, found some negative employment effects in Seattle from the\nongoing minimum wage hikes.  The second (Allegretto et. al.,\n<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FarW0l\">http://bit.ly/2FarW0l</a>) examined six large cities, including Seattle and San\nFrancisco, using more widely accepted methodologies and found no such effects.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy is common in social sciences research.

For now the bulk of the research, starting with a 1994 study by\nCard and Krueger (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf\">http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf</a>), confirms that minimum wage hikes do\nexactly what they&#39;re intended to do: increase income for the poorest workers\nwhile barely changing employment and inflation.</p>\n<p>If Mr. Prentice wants to dispute this, his theory is not enough.

His latest missive seem rooted in the idea that\nEllsworth Toohey, an over-the-top caricature of a false friend, from Rand&#39;s The\nFountainhead, is the heart of every Democrat. It suggests that Wesley Mouch from\nAtlas Shrugged, an envious, incompetent buffoon with too much power, is their\nbrain.</p>\n<p>Sam Prentice really should remember that these are works of fantasy. Most\nthinking folks get over sophomoric fascinations with Ayn Rand by age 25.  It&#39;s\nunseemly in someone older.</p>\n<p>Democrats do not promote equality of outcomes.  However, they are likely to\npromote equality of opportunity, with policies designed to reduce structural\ninequalities, especially regarding children. Lately, Republicans are the\nopposite.  See the tax bill, which barely helps most people, and then only\ntemporarily, but gives large permanent cuts to the wealthy and corporations.</p>\n<p>Finally we come to the minimum wage.  Mr. Prentice repeats his 2015 assertions\nabout minimum wage hikes.  He provides no evidence because he cannot.  The best\nstudy of these issues was  done by Dube, Lester, and Reich in 2010\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA\">http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA</a>).  An easier-to-read summary was by John Schmitt in 2013\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1eWItVi\">http://bit.ly/1eWItVi</a>). The results are conclusive: there is, &quot;no statistically\nsignificant negative employment effects of the minimum wage.&quot;  Nor did minimum\nwage hikes substantially change wages higher up the pay scale.</p>\n<p>Looking at the world through Rand-colored glasses is pure fantasy.</p>\n"

A regulation-free economy would\nallow the unscrupulous to provide slaves. It would allow child labor.  It would\nallow lead paint in children&#39;s toys.  It could not demand truthful advertising\nor require accurate ingredient labels. To say that we would fix these flaws by\nlaw is already to distort free markets.</p>\n<p>Free markets provide many goods and services, but there are many others they\ncannot provide.  How about public goods, such as courts, the military,\nfirefighters, police, roads?  There is no incentive for an individual to pay for\nthem, so there is no incentive for someone to sell them.  Do free-market\nworshipers think we should just do without them?</p>\n<p>And what about when economic exchanges adversely affects someone other than the\nparticipants, known as &quot;negative externalities&quot;?  A free market offers little\nways to prevent industrial pollution, to inhibit overfishing, to avoid\nantibiotic resistant pathogens.</p>\n<p>Free markets also face power imbalances.  How bad would cell service be and how\nhigh would prices be in five years if Verizon bought all its major competitors\ntoday?  When the trust-busters broke up Standard Oil or AT&amp;T, they were helping\nconsumers, who had no power of their own.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the greatest problem in free markets is that they recognize only the\nvalue of money.  If something does not have a price, it is not considered\nvaluable.  Things such as ethical standards have no price-point, so the free\nmarkets reject them.  Uninhibited free markets can have a corrosive effect on\nour entire society.</p>\n"

First, the scientific method: science seeks\ntruth by creating hypotheses and testing them with observation, measurement, and\nexperiment.

Third,\njournalism: reporters explain what is happening by cross-checking the claims of\none person with those of many others.</p>\n<p>Such processes use evidence to determine truth.  It should be obvious that this\nis necessary, but some people act as though evidence doesn&#39;t matter.</p>\n<p>Too many of them are in positions of influence and power: entertainers\npretending to be journalists such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Glenn\nBeck, Congressional leaders such as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, and, of\ncourse, our so-called president.</p>\n<p>Other ones fill these pages with lies that barely try to masquerade as truth.\n<a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice/\">Sam Prentice</a> mixes irrelevant truths with very relevant falsehoods and ignores\nthe scientific evidence of global warming. <a href=\"#/person/Victor+Carli/\">Victor Carli</a> goes further, inventing\nquotations that misstate others&#39; opinions, &quot;correcting&quot; truthful letters by\npresenting easily checked lies, confusing disdain for an officeholder with\ncontempt for the office, and, in an extremely muddled bit of thinking, claiming\nthat acting as an &quot;Unamerican Activist&quot; is an attempt to resurrect McCarthyism.\n(That would be very funny except that he actually seems to mean it.)</p>\n<p>People like this devalue truth itself.

The portion returned to space has been decreasing\nbecause our atmosphere absorbs more energy.</p>\n<p>The strong scientific consensus is that this is caused by human-generated gasses\nin the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. Mr. Carli presents no disputes to\nthis and he brings up irrelevancies. He discusses mathematical proof. Absurd:\nscience is never about that. And he mentions a temperature drop from January,\n2014 to February, 2014 as though that were evidence against global warming. It&#39;s\neasy to see how tiny an anomaly this is at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps\">http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps</a>.</p>\n<p>In short, humans are causing our land, oceans, and atmosphere to heat rapidly.\nThere is no scientific controversy over this. Yet fossil-fuel industry funded\nresearchers muddy the waters. Conservatives, threatened by changes to their\nbusiness models, buy into such crackpot theories.</p>\n<p>Previously, when we&#39;ve had ecological problems, people came together to address\nthem.

The left is sometimes willing to work\nwith right.  The right refuses to work with the left.  It goes back to the\nno-holds-barred days of Newt Gingrich, Tom Delay, and Dennis Hastert.  Think\nabout the fact that we had an impeachment because one President lied about sex,\nbut not one for the Iran-Contra affair.</p>\n<p>Mitch McConnell is a prime example.  Remember when his top legislative priority\nwas to make Obama a one-term president?  He pressured his caucus to walk away\nfrom anything the Democrats were doing.  Then he&#39;d rant about Democratic\npartisanship.  His tactics drove out such moderates as Olympia Snowe, Arlen\nSpecter, and Jim Jeffords.</p>\n<p>Now he&#39;s playing games with the Supreme Court.  He claimed it tradition that the\nSenate does not confirm Supreme Court justices in an election year.  This was\nnonsense, of course, and he&#39;s recently recanted.  I guess he doesn&#39;t want to\nhave to agree to live with such a rule in 2020.  But when the Democrats consider\nrejecting the latest nominee, he starts screaming, &quot;Partisans!&quot;  Pot, meet\nkettle.</p>\n<p>Have you heard about the adult mediating between two children? Johnnie thought\nthey should split the cookie equally between them. Joey thought he should get\nthe whole thing.  The adult said, &quot;Let&#39;s split the difference; Joey can have\nthree fourths and Johnnie one fourth.&quot;  Absurd, right?  But this is what the\nRepublicans now think compromise is.  &quot;We&#39;ll run as far from the center as\npossible, and then ask the Democrats to meet us halfway.&quot;</p>\n<p>We do need statesmen, but in order to find them, the Republican party must stop\ntreating governing as a zero-sum game.

If the electors cannot reach a majority decision, the\nelection goes to the House, which must choose one of the top three electoral\ncandidates.  Here there&#39;s just one vote per state.

A propagandist filmmaker, heir to\nNazi favorite Leni Riefenstahl, inspires little confidence. What would the Right\nthink of a President putting Michael Moore in a position of influence?</p>\n<p>Worse is Steve Bannon&#39;s turn at the helm of Breitbart News. Breitbart was never\nloved by the Left but once Mr. Bannon took charge it became a cesspool of\noffensiveness. The alt-right simply rebrands ideas we&#39;d hoped were outgrown:\nvirulent anti-Semitism, brutal racism, nasty misogyny, and a xenophobic\nanti-immigrant stance at odds with American history and values. While it&#39;s\ndifficult to discern Mr. Bannon&#39;s personal feelings on these issues, the culture\nhe fostered is simply barbarous.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice challenges the Left&#39;s rejection of Mr. Bannon and Donald Trump as\nhypocritical. He suggests we&#39;re ignoring our own emphasis on universally\nincreasing prosperity. First, it&#39;s been impossible to discern actual policy\npositions from the Trump campaign or its aftermath.. More importantly, when you\nchoose with whom you will ally, you must choose holistically, not on a\nparticular stance. Perhaps the jury is still out on Mr. Bannon, and perhaps not,\nbut the entire campaign of hatred has shown Donald Trump to be someone with whom\nthe Left has too little in common.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is offensive in the extreme, the greatest danger to our Republic\nsince the Civil War.

Unfortunately,\nthat does not include Mr. Prentice.</p>\n<p>He reaches the exact same wrong conclusions as early reports on right-wing\nmedia, conclusions already discredited by professional fact-checkers and charity\nwatchers. (And his is independent research?) Applying his techniques to the 990\nfilings from Amnesty International, Oxfam, and the Red Cross, would show that\nthese also must be horrible frauds, awarding grants totaling only 25.7%, 29.5%\nand 3.98% of their budgets, respectively. This should help demonstrate that his\nmethods are wrong.</p>\n<p>The trouble, as Mr. Prentice has already been informed, is that the Clinton\nFoundation is more like these organizations, running its own programs, not\nmaking grants like the Carnegie Foundation. So, on that 990 form, line 10, he\nneeds to divide line 25(B) by line 25(A) to determine the portion of the\nfoundation&#39;s spending that went to charitable work. 25(C) and 25(D) represent\nmanagement overhead and fund-raising. Note that Charity Navigator and Charity\nWatch give the Clinton Foundation top marks.</p>\n<p>The bigger issue is that Sam Prentice and his peers can stick to such balderdash\nin the face of the clear evidence that it&#39;s fallacious. Something has gone quite\nwrong when people let their ideology overshadow the truth. This is not limited\nto the right-wing, but it seems much more prominent there, starting with the\nlikes of Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich, and leading eventually to the most\npreposterous candidate for president any major party has ever nominated.</p>\n"

If we want to discuss authoritarianism, by all\nmeans let&#39;s do so, but don&#39;t call it liberalism; that&#39;s something very\ndifferent.</p>\n<p>For much of our history, political absurdities appeared equally often on the\nLeft and the Right.

(Unlike certain other\nletter-writers who do seem to believe that repeating their idiotic insults will\nmake them true.) Mr. Prentice exhorts us to &quot;return to the spirit of the\nConstitution&quot;. Let&#39;s try to see what that might mean.</p>\n<p>The American revolutionaries won their independence and put in place a small,\nweak government. They were not happy with it. They wrote the Constitution\nexpressly to give the national government more power. Anyone who wants to wrap\nhimself in both the spirit of the Constitution and the notion of a small\ngovernment must come to terms with that contradiction.</p>\n<p>But the Founders were afraid of investing too much power in any individual or\ninstitution. That sounds a lot like what I described for progressivism.\nProgressives worry about the concentration of power in the hands of the rich, of\nthe government, of corporations. The Constitution dealt with this concern in an\nintricate series of checks on each branch of government, on the federal\ngovernment as a whole, on the states, and even on the popular will of its\ncitizens.</p>\n<p>Returning to the spirit of the Constitution involves ensuring that no\nindividuals or institutions amass enough power to threaten the rest of us. Or\nthat at the very least there are counterbalancing institutions to keep them in\ncheck.</p>\n<p>Please remember that those who fought for independence, wrote the Declaration,\nwrote the Constitution, and served as our first generation of leaders were the\nprogressives of their day. To support the spirit of their document is to support\nthe spirit of progressivism.</p>\n"

Mr. Corso points out that on the day President Obama took office the\nfederal debt stood at $10.6 trillion, meaning that all the previous presidents\ncombined had racked up a total debt of $10.6 trillion.

He specifically called out the\nPresident on high gasoline prices, denying that external forces were a critical\nfactor. Now that prices are improved, Mr. Corso is willing to credit only those\nforces. On all other points, he ignores or contradicts figures easily checked.</p>\n<p>I maintained then and still maintain that Presidential policies have little to\ndo with short-term economic outcomes: they can help steer around crises and set\nthe country on its long-term path. On quarterly or annual economic numbers, any\nPresident has limited influence.</p>\n<p>Chuck Corso is simply braying stale talking points from Fox&#39;s talking heads. I\nremember when the right had some intellectual heft. Can you imagine what William\nSafire or William F. Buckley, Jr. would make of Mr. Corso&#39;s sophistry?</p>\n"

What they did best was to build\na living document, designed to change with the times. Madison&#39;s optimism that\npeople could adapt his Constitutional framework to the needs of their times\nproved true.

We\nbelieve government is the banding together of its people to prevent the abuse of\nthe weak by the strong, ensuring that all get a fair shot at life, liberty and\nthe pursuit of happiness. Progressives want the government to prevent the rich\nand powerful from rigging the system so they and their children have the best of\neverything. We want the American dream available to all.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you want to know how scientists think, ask them instead of Sam\nPrentice. If there are none handy, you can ask schoolchildren about the\nscientific method. They will explain that science isn&#39;t the search for Truth;\nthat&#39;s left for theologians.</p>\n<p>Scientists create theories about the natural world and make observations and\nexperiments that attempt to disprove them. The longer a theory withstands such\nattempts, the more credible it becomes. Eventually a theory becomes established\nas the consensus of the scientific community. That is the current state of the\ntheory that human activity is responsible for global warming. Tellingly, Mr.\nPrentice only sees or only believes studies that support his ideology.

Even Goldwater gets blame -- for starting the\nmovement.</p>\n<p>Corso compares the 7.8% 2009 unemployment rate with today&#39;s 8.1%. Should we\nblame Reagan for the increase from 7.5% to 10.8% in October, 1982? How about\nBush Sr., who oversaw it rise from 5.4% to 7.3%? Bush Jr. inherited 4.2% from\nClinton and ended at 7.8%. Was that his fault? Can we concede that presidents\nhave limited influence on unemployment?</p>\n<p>Then there&#39;s decreasing median income. Fewer jobs, lower average income: very\nsimple. Median income peaked at the end of the Clinton years; it&#39;s been falling\nsince, with a minor increase 2004-2007. Our tax policy favors the wealthy. Is it\nsurprising average citizens aren&#39;t doing well?</p>\n<p>Next: gasoline prices, which parallel the global economy. If Obama is\nresponsible for increased fuel prices, he&#39;s also responsible for the economic\nimprovement. If it&#39;s just about price, the record high occurred during the Bush\nadministration.</p>\n<p>Finally, national debt: federal debt increased 51% during Obama&#39;s first term.\nWhy is Corso complaining now?

For\nall singles of whatever background, eligible income below $8,350 is taxed at 10%\nand all of it above $372,950 is taxed at 35%, etc.  Note that his notion that\nthe fifth or fourteenth amendment could trump the sixteenth is fairly bizarre.</p>\n<p>Mr. Prentice says our constitution is not a living document.  I disagree.   The\nentire legal history of our republic is one of continual refinement and\nredefinition.  A country founded on strict constructionism wouldn&#39;t likely have\nsurvived a generation.  The words of John Marshall, our greatest Supreme Court\njustice, are quite relevant.  Our constitution, he said, is &quot;intended to endure\nfor ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human\naffairs.&quot;</p>\n<p>Strict constructionism is an intellectually bankrupt legal philosophy. Even\nAntonin Scalia said, &quot;I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to\nbe.&quot;  When Sam Prentice claims that much of our government is illegitimate\nbecause the constitution does not specifically allow for it, he is struggling to\nhold on to a discredited view of our country that has held sway only among a\nsmall cadre of libertarian scholars, not with the founders, not with most\nscholars, not with the judges, and not with the people.

    "Content": "<p>The most recent Andover Town Meeting was a fiasco.  Oh, it was more civil than\nmany meetings.  No one stormed out.  Few harsh words were spoken.  But it\naccomplished nothing.  The reason for this meeting is to adopt a budget to send\nto town-wide referendum.  And if that can&#39;t be accomplished, the meeting should\ngive clear guidance to the Board of Finance as to how the proposed budget should\nbe altered.  This meeting managed to do neither.</p>\n<p>There was a total of one motion to reduce the budget.  With this motion, Ed Nagy\nproposed a 1% across-the-board cut on all general town accounts except those\nalready reduced.  That motion was soundly defeated.  But at least Mr. Nagy made\na positive contribution.  Everyone else who voted no on the budget did so\nwithout offering a single motion to reduce even a penny from the budget\nproposal.</p>\n<p>There were brief discussions about cutting various items, including the\nelementary school budget, town office-holders&#39; salaries, and snow removal.\nWithout any motions made though, the Board of Finance cannot know if these were\nthe ideas of the majority of voters or only of a small group.</p>\n<p>Those who went to the meeting should feel proud of participating in our\ndemocracy.  But those who voted against the proposed budget without offering any\nconcrete alternatives need to think a little more about what they accomplished.\nAt least we won&#39;t incur the costs of running an unnecessary referendum, but we\nmust still be spending a few hundred dollars in postage and precious hours of\nour own time on yet another town meeting.</p>\n<p>I personally believe the proposed budget is under funded.  But the charter\nprohibits the Town Meeting from increasing it.  I&#39;m starting to wonder if our\nTown Meeting / referendum approval method is fundamentally unworkable.  It seems\nthat the way it now works is that the Board of Finance works very hard to\npresent a mostly reasonable initial budget, then we run through a few iterations\nof painful reductions after failures at town meetings or referendums until\neveryone is too tired of fighting it out and an under funded budget squeaks\nthrough.  Is this how we really want our town to function?  Do we need to change\nthe charter?</p>\n<p>Please come to next Tuesday&#39;s Town Meeting not to gripe but to help build a\nworkable budget.</p>\n"

The mill rate\nactually decreased in the latest budget.  The new mill rate is 26.3.  That means\nthat the average bottom-line increase over the last two years is 2.54%.  Our\nprevious administration overspent several years&#39; budgets so much that we ended\nup $750,000 in debt.  If we add just a third of that to the 05-06 budget, the\naverage annual spending increase is only 1.22%.  If we compare to last year the\nnumbers look higher, because last year, with the financial fiasco hanging over\nour heads, we removed everything we could in order to pass a budget.  Even so,\nfocusing on the bottom-line increase isn&#39;t that important.  Most of us are more\ninterested in how our taxes are affected.  This year&#39;s tax increase is 4.24%.\nIf you compare it to 2005, the average annual increase is 1.13%.  Including\none-third of the surcharge in the 2005-06 budget we get an actual average annual\ndecrease of 0.62% per year!</p>\n<p>Once again, complaints have been published that we didn&#39;t have up-to-date\nyear-to-date figures at the Town Meeting.  Having three-week old figures was\nunfortunate, but expecting up-to-the-minute numbers is missing the point.  No\nsignificant budget can possibly get each line item right.  The question at the\nend of the year is how far off were the various lines, and how close was the\noverall total?  I&#39;m sure this year energy costs were underestimated and snow\nremoval was overestimated; that doesn&#39;t proves much.  Using these incomplete\nnumbers to adjust spending priorities simply invites trouble.</p>\n<p>Once again, salaries of elected officials are under discussion.

    "Content": "<p>Andover has entered the silly season.  The budget has been defeated twice in an\nuproar over salaries.  The Board of Finance, whose diligence and accord has been\ninstrumental in undoing the mess, is now squabbling.  Others are proposing\nsqueezing out a few more nickels.</p>\n<p>A supplemental tax paid off previous years&#39; overspending.  But we slashed basic\nservices.  The rainy day fund is almost dry.  Our roads are falling apart.  This\nyear&#39;s budget takes baby steps towards rectifying these problems.  The increase\nlooks high because last year&#39;s budget was so low, decreasing non-educational\nspending 20%.  The current proposed tax increase is 4.2% and the average\nbottom-line increase for the past two years is only 2.5%.  If you include the\nmoney previously overspent, this year&#39;s is lower than the 05-06 budget.  We\naren&#39;t overspending.</p>\n<p>Some claim officials&#39; salaries are too high and other employees received little.\nNonsense.  The salaries are still well below what comparable officials in most\ntowns receive.  Other employees may get too little; this should be addressed by\nthe Board of Finance.  But elected officials&#39; salaries are set by a town\nmeeting.  We did that.  I&#39;m sorry some don&#39;t like the results, but that&#39;s how\ndemocracy works.</p>\n<p>A member of the Board of Finance recommends rejecting the budget.  This is\ndisturbing.  On the Board of Education, we hash things out at our public\nmeetings, but once a decision is made, we don&#39;t publicly criticize it.  Whether\nwe agree with one another or not, we don&#39;t snipe, we don&#39;t bicker; we present a\nunited face.  It&#39;s a shame the Board of Finance can&#39;t do the same.  The most\nconservative and the most liberal members of the board and several former First\nSelectmen spoke in favor of the budget.  It&#39;s disappointing to see members\nbreaking this accord.</p>\n<p>The proposed cuts don&#39;t mean much in a $10 million budget.  All the cuts\ndiscussed don&#39;t even total the $27,000 that would reduce the mill rate 0.1\npoints.  That&#39;s 0.27% of the budget, or $9 per capita.  For my family of four,\nit&#39;s around $3 per month.  If we have that much surplus at the end of the year,\nlet&#39;s improve our emergency fund.</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s get together and vote to pass this reasonable budget.  Let&#39;s end the silly\nseason!</p>\n"
