Antifa is a loosely knit\ncollection of opponents of fascism across the country. They promote direct\naction, sometimes even violence, and many on the left criticize them for that,\nbut there is little actual violence.

        "Content": "<p>The coronavirus crisis demonstrates one difference between conservatism and\nliberalism. Conservatism promotes competition and the virtue of selfishness. It\nargues that freedom arises when individuals compete in literal and philosophical\nmarketplaces for selfish goals. Modern liberalism says there is also benefit in\ncooperation. It notes that governments and other institutions arise as\ncooperative associations for mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>Who resists wearing a face mask?</p>\n<p>Conservatives, of course. &quot;Wearing a mask does not protect me from the virus.\nWhy should I erode my freedom, consenting to this tyrannical and uncomfortable\nfashion accessory?&quot; (That these same people insist that bulletproof backpacks,\narmed school guards, and live-shooter drills are just the price of freedom is a\nfuture discussion.)</p>\n<p>They&#39;re correct. Face masks do little to protect wearers. Liberals agree; why\ndon&#39;t they also object? Simple: liberals understand we are part of a society.\nGroup well-being sometimes trumps personal choices. Wearing a mask does not\nprotect me; it protects those around me. Having others wear masks protects me.</p>\n<p>&quot;But,&quot; sputter the conservatives, &quot;didn&#39;t Benjamin Franklin say, &#39;Those who\nwould give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve\nneither Liberty nor Safety?&#39;&quot; Yes. He also said, &quot;We must, indeed, all hang\ntogether or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.&quot; Wearing a mask to\nreduce the spread of a pandemic is not a major infringement on liberty. It&#39;s a\ncollective solution to a shared problem.</p>\n<p>For centuries, philosophers debated how altruism might arise in a society of\nself-interest. In the 1980s, social scientists found the answer. Robert\nAxelrod&#39;s The Evolution of Cooperation demonstrates mathematically that a small\ncollection of cooperating individuals can out-compete their more selfish\nbrethren. Liberals&#39; notion of community action even at some loss to oneself is\nevolutionarily sound.</p>\n<p>So wear your masks.  By benefiting your community, you also benefit yourself.</p>\n"

I just read\nOreskes and Conway&#39;s <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>, and I highly recommend it (or the\ndocumentary based on it.) It describes how since the 1950s there has been a\ncoordinated effort to discredit inconvenient science, how an overlapping cast of\ncharacters has been involved in denying that tobacco causes lung cancer, that\nReagan&#39;s Star Wars idea was infeasible, that power company emissions cause acid\nrain, that CFCs cause the ozone hole, that second-hand smoke is dangerous, and\nthat burning fossil fuels causes global warming.</p>\n<p>This process started with the tobacco companies. Because they had no reasonable\nway to attack the science heads-on, they formed an array of pseudo-independent\norganizations meant only to sow doubt about the science. They managed to\nconvince journalists to cover this as though there was actual scientific\ncontroversy. They kept this up forty years, selling many more cigarettes along\nthe way.</p>\n<p>This worked so well that although scientists made it clear that Reagan&#39;s Star\nWars wasn&#39;t possible, a small group used the tobacco play-book to attack the\nscience detailing nuclear winter. The same people then promoted acid rain\ndenial, ozone obfuscation, and the current project of denying global warming.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, the science is clear. But former cold warriors like Fred\nSinger, Robert Jastrow, Fred Leitz, and Bill Nierenberg made a career of\nmuddying the waters, trying to make us believe the answers are not\nwell-established. They found gullible journalists and bystanders to promote\ntheir fantasies. The book makes a credible case that the motivation of such\nonce-prominent scientists is that they believe they&#39;re still fighting Communism,\nthat regulations yield a slippery slope towards socialism.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s well worth a read.</p>\n"

This is important, given how skeptics\nemphasize this pause: only a bit more than 2% of the total heat in the\nsystem is in the atmosphere.  Over 93% is in the oceans.

        "Content": "<p><a href=\"#/person/Dan+Armstrong\">Dan Armstrong</a> argues that the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate\nchange is exaggerated, listing academics who challenge that consensus. I planned\na parody letter, listing professors rejecting evolution or promoting flat-earth\ntheories. It could have been amusing. But instead, over a few letters I will\ndiscuss the scientists Mr. Armstrong has presented. First, a few words about\nscience.</p>\n<p>Mr. Armstrong says, &quot;Predicting future events based on past events is not\nexperimentally proven science; it is statistical forecasting.&quot; No, creating\nprediction models is exactly what science does, combining past events and\ntheoretical understanding in varying proportions. For sciences like Newtonian\nmechanics we create experiments; others, like cosmology, are much harder to\nverify experimentally. Always, though, science is about creating predictive and\nresilient models.</p>\n<p>Noting that weather models are inherently complex and accurate over only short\nterms, Mr. Armstrong asks how much more complex climate models must be: how\ncould we know they&#39;re accurate? Well, models of larger phenomena smooth the\nsmaller systems. With non-linear feedback and turbulence, fluid dynamics is\nextremely complex. Predicting the waves would be impossible, right? Yet we have\nprecise and accurate tide charts far in advance. It&#39;s similar with climate and\nweather. Climate is driven by different inputs than weather; many trends can be\nmodeled. It&#39;s not easy; climate models are certainly complex. But it&#39;s not the\nimpossible task Dan Armstrong claims.</p>\n<p>Another letter suggests there&#39;s no true consensus because many scientists and\nscholars disagree. This is incorrect; there is a very strong consensus. That\ndoes not imply unanimity, but by most counts at least 97% of climate scientists\nagree that global temperature is rapidly rising, that humans are a substantial\ncause. Of 54,195 peer-reviewed papers studied between 1991 and 2015, only five\nrejected the consensus. And the agreement increases with climate expertise.

This is a\nsomewhat boring follow-up to that, backing it up with numbers showing\nthese partisan differences from 1948 through 2012.  This information\nis in Blinder and Watson&#39;s 2014 paper. (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/blinder-watson\">http://bit.ly/blinder-watson</a>)</p>\n<p>GDP growth averaged 2.54% under Republicans, 4.35% under Democrats.\nGrowth per capita is similar, as is growth across most industries.\nThe economy was in recession an average of 1.1 quarters during\nDemocratic terms and 4.6 quarters during Republican ones.</p>\n<p>Employment growth under Democrats averaged 2.59% and under\nRepublicans, 1.17%.  The unemployment rate for the Democrats averaged\n5.64% and for the Republicans 6.01%. (This was not statistically\nsignificant.)</p>\n<p>The S &amp; P 500 Index grew at an annual 2.70% rate under the GOP and at\n8.08% when a Democrat was in the White House.  Corporate profits grew\n5.62% during Democratic administrations and 4.74% during Republican\nones.</p>\n<p>Worker hourly productivity grew 2.55% and compensation at 1.81% during\nDemocratic years, but by 2.08% and 1.43%, respectively. during\nRepublican ones.  Budget deficit averaged 1.5% of GDP for Democrats\nand 2.2% for Republicans.</p>\n<p>The inflation rate was 2.97% for Democrats and 3.2% for Republicans;\nit rose an average of 1.05 percentage points over a Democratic term\nand fell an average of 0.83 points during a Republican one.  This is\nless hopeful to Republicans than it sounds, though, since rising\ninflation is a sign of high growth, falling inflation of low growth.</p>\n<p>There is little to explain these facts.  My point is not that\nDemocratic presidents are much better for the economy than are\nRepublicans.  I actually believe the president has little to do with\nyear-to-year economic performance.  But some seem to think that\nRepublican are much better for the economy.  They are wrong, pure and\nsimple.</p>\n"

The point is that those crediting the Trump\nadministration for the economy must explain why Democratic\nadministrations have invariably been better.  Doing better than other\nRepublican administrations is too low a bar.  The economy performs\nmuch better under Democrats.</p>\n<p>Nor do liberals &quot;avoid citing job creation and unemployment numbers.&quot;\nI&#39;d pointed out that these exact numbers show continuing trends from\nthe Obama years, not any bump from current policies.</p>\n<p>If this writer believes Obama&#39;s indifference toward Israel compares to\nTrump&#39;s offending Europe, much of the Middle East and Africa,\nAustralia, Mexico, and even Canada, then he entirely misunderstands\nthe world.  Then he conflates Trump&#39;s embrace of dictators with Obama\nattending a Cuban baseball game.</p>\n<p>Shown constant issues with the Trump administration, his supporters\nsquirm to find any example they think demonstrates Obama or Clinton\ndoing something vaguely related.

He sows discord and hatred, he belittles and\nbullies, he lies incessantly.  He gets his information from right-wing\nbroadcasters, but calls the media the enemy of the people.  He\ndenigrates allies and praises dictators.  He fashions trade wars\nbecause of economic illiteracy.</p>\n<p>His inept administration has seen unprecedented turnover.\nInvestigations into Russian interference have generated 33 indictments\nand won convictions of three senior Trump associates.</p>\n<p>The only positive is the booming economy (although signs point to a\nslow-down.)  What credit can Mr. Trump claim?  10-year charts of stock\nprices, unemployment, or total jobs make obvious that these numbers\nmerely continue trends from the early Obama years.  For instance,\nunder Trump the Dow Jones has seen an average annual gain of 11.63%,\nquite good for a Republican -- who had only averaged 3.52% since Nixon\n-- but in line with the Democratic average of 11.0%, and below both\nObama&#39;s and Clinton&#39;s numbers.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s it.  There is nothing else good to say.  He follows Obama&#39;s\nunfortunate practice of governing through executive orders, and is\nclobbered in the courts over it.  His only substantive legislation was\nthe Tax Scam bill -- not something to brag about.</p>\n<p>Now, ignoring the actual crisis -- climate change -- Mr. Trump shut\ndown the government over a manufactured one.  Trump didn&#39;t try funding\nhis wall for two years, but now it&#39;s an emergency?  After proclaiming\nhe would take responsibility for a shutdown, he&#39;s blaming\nCongressional Democrats?</p>\n<p>This is not the behavior of a sane, competent leader.

It&#39;s even scarier when the one\ndoing so proclaims others to be scientifically illiterate.</p>\n<p>I presented two comprehensive academic examinations of minimum wage\nhikes.  Sam Prentice claims that my conclusions must be wrong because\nthey don&#39;t match his theory.  Science is done differently.  Evidence\ndisproves theories, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>There have been two additional major studies.  The first (Jardim, et.\nal., <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo\">http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo</a>), using new methodologies which are\ncredible but not yet widely recognized, found some negative employment\neffects in Seattle from the ongoing minimum wage hikes.  The second\n(Allegretto et. al., <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2FarW0l\">http://bit.ly/2FarW0l</a>) examined six large cities,\nincluding Seattle and San Francisco, using more widely accepted\nmethodologies and found no such effects.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy is common in social sciences research.  Usually,\noutlier studies will not be replicated.  Occasionally, they reveal\ninsights that change the theory.  For now the bulk of the research,\nstarting with a 1994 study by Card and Krueger\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf\">http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf</a>), confirms that minimum wage hikes do exactly\nwhat they&#39;re intended to do: increase income for the poorest workers\nwhile barely changing employment and inflation.</p>\n<p>If Mr. Prentice wants to dispute this, his theory is not enough.

The philosophy he expounds sounds so much\nlike Ayn Rand&#39;s that I assumed he had read her works.  I can&#39;t really\nrecommend them; her writing is far too didactic to make for readable\nnovels.
