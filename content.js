Antifa is a loosely knit\ncollection of opponents of fascism across the country.

        "Content": "<p>The coronavirus crisis demonstrates one difference between conservatism and\nliberalism. Conservatism promotes competition and the virtue of selfishness. It\nargues that freedom arises when individuals compete in literal and philosophical\nmarketplaces for selfish goals. Modern liberalism says there is also benefit in\ncooperation. It notes that governments and other institutions arise as\ncooperative associations for mutual benefit.</p>\n<p>Who resists wearing a face mask?</p>\n<p>Conservatives, of course. &quot;Wearing a mask does not protect me from the virus.\nWhy should I erode my freedom, consenting to this tyrannical and uncomfortable\nfashion accessory?&quot; (That these same people insist that bulletproof backpacks,\narmed school guards, and live-shooter drills are just the price of freedom is a\nfuture discussion.)</p>\n<p>They&#39;re correct. Face masks do little to protect wearers. Liberals agree; why\ndon&#39;t they also object? Simple: liberals understand we are part of a society.\nGroup well-being sometimes trumps personal choices. Wearing a mask does not\nprotect me; it protects those around me. Having others wear masks protects me.</p>\n<p>&quot;But,&quot; sputter the conservatives, &quot;didn&#39;t Benjamin Franklin say, &#39;Those who\nwould give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve\nneither Liberty nor Safety?&#39;&quot; Yes. He also said, &quot;We must, indeed, all hang\ntogether or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.&quot; Wearing a mask to\nreduce the spread of a pandemic is not a major infringement on liberty. It&#39;s a\ncollective solution to a shared problem.</p>\n<p>For centuries, philosophers debated how altruism might arise in a society of\nself-interest. In the 1980s, social scientists found the answer. Robert\nAxelrod&#39;s The Evolution of Cooperation demonstrates mathematically that a small\ncollection of cooperating individuals can out-compete their more selfish\nbrethren. Liberals&#39; notion of community action even at some loss to oneself is\nevolutionarily sound.</p>\n<p>So wear your masks.  By benefiting your community, you also benefit yourself.</p>\n"

I just read\nOreskes and Conway&#39;s <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>, and I highly recommend it (or the\ndocumentary based on it.) It describes how since the 1950s there has been a\ncoordinated effort to discredit inconvenient science, how an overlapping cast of\ncharacters has been involved in denying that tobacco causes lung cancer, that\nReagan&#39;s Star Wars idea was infeasible, that power company emissions cause acid\nrain, that CFCs cause the ozone hole, that second-hand smoke is dangerous, and\nthat burning fossil fuels causes global warming.</p>\n<p>This process started with the tobacco companies. Because they had no reasonable\nway to attack the science heads-on, they formed an array of pseudo-independent\norganizations meant only to sow doubt about the science. They managed to\nconvince journalists to cover this as though there was actual scientific\ncontroversy. They kept this up forty years, selling many more cigarettes along\nthe way.</p>\n<p>This worked so well that although scientists made it clear that Reagan&#39;s Star\nWars wasn&#39;t possible, a small group used the tobacco play-book to attack the\nscience detailing nuclear winter. The same people then promoted acid rain\ndenial, ozone obfuscation, and the current project of denying global warming.</p>\n<p>In each of these cases, the science is clear. But former cold warriors like Fred\nSinger, Robert Jastrow, Fred Leitz, and Bill Nierenberg made a career of\nmuddying the waters, trying to make us believe the answers are not\nwell-established. They found gullible journalists and bystanders to promote\ntheir fantasies. The book makes a credible case that the motivation of such\nonce-prominent scientists is that they believe they&#39;re still fighting Communism,\nthat regulations yield a slippery slope towards socialism.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s well worth a read.</p>\n"
