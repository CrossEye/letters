He weasels,\nclaiming to condemn the violence but drawing unjustified parallels with other\nrecent events.</p>\n<p>Where to start? How about this? &quot;It would be difficult to ascertain whether they\nwere infiltrated by members of Antifa... but it&#39;s entirely possible.&quot; This\nsounds like, &quot;Have you stopped beating your wife?&quot; It is the worst kind of\nweaseling, making a claim by pretending it&#39;s an open question. Well it&#39;s not\ntrue. This has been fact-checked, and it&#39;s an unvarnished lie.\n(<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/8\">http://sauyet.com/link/8</a>)</p>\n<p>Or how about this? &quot;I was deeply saddened to see a young Air Force female --\nunarmed -- shot to death by security. [...] Just imagine if this officer had\nshot and killed a Black Lives Matter protester.&quot; Funny, I don&#39;t recall Mr.\nDenley critiquing the police violence marring otherwise peaceful BLM protests\nthis summer. Is it that clubs and cruisers and pepper spray are fine but guns\nare not? Yes, these were mostly peaceful protests, with violence usually\ninstigated by the police. See <a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/9\">http://sauyet.com/link/9</a>. And &quot;a young Air Force\nfemale&quot;?! Does anyone believe that he would have written &quot;a young Air Force\nmale&quot;? Why does her gender matter?</p>\n<p>And how about calling Antifa &quot;a large, violent, anti-government organization?&quot;\nObviously he cites no evidence for this. There is none. Antifa is a loosely knit\ncollection of opponents of fascism across the country. They promote direct\naction, sometimes even violence, and many on the left criticize them for that,\nbut there is little actual violence. Of course, the right-wing has perpetrated\nthe majority of all recent US terrorist incidents. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/10\">http://sauyet.com/link/10</a>)</p>\n<p>Mr. Denley, weaseling demeans you. If you believe something, state it. If you\nclaim to have facts, please cite some sources.</p>\n"

We can safely ignore an outlet like like oann.com (questionable\nsource, factual: low). One like washingtonpost.com (left-center bias, factual:\nhigh), is trustworthy on facts, but might present bias in story\nchoice/headlines.</p>\n<p>To test a story, look to the fact-checkers. My favorites are FactCheck.org\n(least biased, factual: very high), Snopes.com (least biased, factual: high),\nand PolitiFact.com (least biased, factual: high).</p>\n<p>Recent letters fail basic fact-checking. Sam Prentice reiterates claims that\nBiden promoted election fraud. Snopes says: False. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/1\">http://sauyet.com/link/1</a>)\nIt&#39;s like claiming the police&#39;s Homicide Squad is there to commit homicides. Or\nhe misquotes Biden&#39;s, &quot;I don&#39;t only need you to get me elected; I need you once\nI&#39;m elected&quot; by dropping the &quot;only&quot;, which he would have discovered reading\nPolitifact (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/2\">http://sauyet.com/link/2</a>). The rest is similarly absurd, but it&#39;s\nworth countering that the 81 million people voted either for the candidate who\nkept us safe by following health guidelines, or against the candidate whose\nsuperspreader rallies risked more deaths.</p>\n<p>George Kitchin gets just one thing right. Snopes explains that yes, those\nnotorious cages were built under Obama. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/3\">http://sauyet.com/link/3</a>) But, as\nFactCheck points out (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/4\">http://sauyet.com/link/4</a>), Trump&#39;s blanket policy was what\ncaused vast family separations. His claim about Gold Star families is laughable;\nsee the Wikipedia page about it. (<a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/5\">http://sauyet.com/link/5</a>) So is suggesting\nthat Trump only insulted reporters under massive provocation. Reporting\ndemonstrable lies is not insulting. See, for instance, <a href=\"http://sauyet.com/link/6\">http://sauyet.com/link/6</a>.\nRegarding his absurdities on the ACA and Covid: extraordinary claims require\nextraordinary proof. Where&#39;s his evidence?</p>\n<p>And then there&#39;s Ed Kozlowski, the poor dear, who must have been bullied by a\nprogressive during his childhood. His letter presents no actual facts to\ndispute.</p>\n"

He presents no evidence and it&#39;s\nobvious why: because there is none. Conspiracy theories postulate a grand cabal\nout to deny Trump a second term: Republicans and Democrats, governors,\nlegislators, election officials, postal workers, voting machine makers, polling\nworkers, and, I&#39;m guessing, Santa&#39;s elves. But I&#39;ll let you in on a little\nsecret. There actually is a large group trying to oust Trump: the American\npeople. Sorry about that.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s not only that there&#39;s no evidence. The Trump campaign has repeatedly\nlitigated these claims in court. His results: 1 win, 46 losses. Someone call\nGuinness Book: has any plaintiff lost so many cases in one month?</p>\n<p>Speaking of one month, in 2016, fans here credited Trump for the post-election\nstock market bump. It was impressive, a one-month jump of 7.01% in. I&#39;m\nwondering, do those same people credit Biden for the rise of 9.03% this past\nmonth?</p>\n<p>Anyway, absent any evidence, those peddling huge election fraud are simply\nconspiracy theorists. As heard recently, &quot;Don&#39;t laugh at kids for believing in\nSanta Claus; some adults believe Trump won the election.&quot;</p>\n"
