Scott Sauyet's Letters to the Editor
====================================

This is a small app to house my letters to the editor.

I am one of those gadflies who regularly writes letters to the local weekly
newspaper, covering mostly U.S. national policy discussions, and occasional local
issues.

They are now hosted on GitHub pages, and available at http://letters.sauyet.com/
(and also at an alias, http://letters.fourwindssoft.com/, for reasons not worth
explaining here.)

The actual letter text is in the [folder `content`][co] alongside some metadata.


Building
--------

This content is regenerated by a build step called by [the rebuild
workflow][rb].  This calls the file [build.js][bu] which does two things:

- it parses all the files in the `content` folder, collecting the metadata and
  using [Marked][ma] to convert the content to markdown, then combines these
  into a single JS file [content.js][cn]

- it merges that file as well as the CSS and the main script in a copy of the
  [index file][in], [letters.html][ht], to offer a single-file version of the UI

Then the workflow checks these generated files back into the repository, and
this main branch will now be served by GitHub Pages.


To Do
-----

  - [X] Responsiveness working on mobile
  - [X] Make all URLs end in `/`
  - [ ] Give series their own code
  - [X] Change document title on navigation
  - [ ] Make randomness a daily (weekly?) fixed set with "more"
  - [ ] Expand search from exact phrase to partial matches, but mostly whole word
        (E.g. "Dan" matches "Dan Armstrong" but not "dangerous".  
        But should "democra" match "Democrats" and "democracy?  TBD)
  - [X] Separate the theme data and code
  - [X] Simplify router by adding event and removing `after` param
  - [ ] Clean up CSS (again!)
  - [ ] Make a changeTheme URL, so I can share the themes directly
  - [ ] <del>(Possibly) add theme-builder or load-from-url mechanism</del>
