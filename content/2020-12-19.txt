Fact-checking is straightforward. When something makes your blood boil, test
whether it passes muster. Check your sources with
https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/, which describes media sources' biases and
accuracy. We can safely ignore an outlet like like oann.com (questionable
source, factual: low). One like washingtonpost.com (left-center bias, factual:
high), is trustworthy on facts, but might present bias in story
choice/headlines.

To test a story, look to the fact-checkers. My favorites are FactCheck.org
(least biased, factual: very high), Snopes.com (least biased, factual: high),
and PolitiFact.com (least biased, factual: high).

Recent letters fail basic fact-checking. Sam Prentice reiterates claims that
Biden promoted election fraud. Snopes says: False. (http://sauyet.com/link/1)
It's like claiming the police's Homicide Squad is there to commit homicides. Or
he misquotes Biden's, "I don't only need you to get me elected; I need you once
I'm elected" by dropping the "only", which he would have discovered reading
Politifact (http://sauyet.com/link/2). The rest is similarly absurd, but it's
worth countering that the 81 million people voted either for the candidate who
kept us safe by following health guidelines, or against the candidate whose
superspreader rallies risked more deaths.

George Kitchin gets just one thing right. Snopes explains that yes, those
notorious cages were built under Obama. (http://sauyet.com/link/3) But, as
FactCheck points out (http://sauyet.com/link/4), Trump's blanket policy was what
caused vast family separations. His claim about Gold Star families is laughable;
see the Wikipedia page about it. (http://sauyet.com/link/5) So is suggesting
that Trump only insulted reporters under massive provocation. Reporting
demonstrable lies is not insulting. See, for instance, http://sauyet.com/link/6.
Regarding his absurdities on the ACA and Covid: extraordinary claims require
extraordinary proof. Where's his evidence?

And then there's Ed Kozlowski, the poor dear, who must have been bullied by a
progressive during his childhood. His letter presents no actual facts to
dispute.
