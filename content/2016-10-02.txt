Larry Zimmerman had me going at first.  I thought he was seriously defending
Donald Trump.  I did eventually realize that anyone intelligent enough to quote
the definitions of misogyny, xenophobia, and racism could not possibly mistake
Mr. Trump's pronouncements for anything else.

Yes, it is a bit amusing, if crude, to counter Donald Trump's statements on
women and specifically on Carly Fiorina, Rosie O'Donnell, Megyn Kelly, and
Alicia Machado with the notion that he "married three beautiful women".  Less
funny was the bit about Mr. Trump treating all citizens with respect: see his
Twitter feed.  Of course with all the anti-Muslim, anti-Mexican rhetoric,
there's really no joke possible about the candidate's xenophobia.

But Mr. Zimmerman has another gag.  He implies Donald Trump is an improvement on
President Obama, who when elected "knew absolutely nothing about government" and
whose mantra of hope and change utterly failed.  That's hysterical!

A builder and entertainer who started with millions in gifts from his father,
declared bankruptcy six times, stiffed thousands of contractors, who belittles
anyone who disagrees with him -- this man knows much more about government than
a former Senator, state legislator, community organizer, and professional
constitutional scholar?  I'm in stitches.

Also, suggesting there's been no change is comical. During the Obama years,
we've seen the longest run of improving job numbers in history, a fall of the
unemployment rate to 4.9%.  We've seen the stock market boom, household incomes
grow.   We've seen two wars concluded, a 24% drop in the trade deficit, growing
energy independence, 15.2 million fewer uninsured, and a large reduction in
illegal immigration.  Even gasoline prices are great.  "Hope and change" seems
to have worked.

The big trouble with Mr. Zimmerman's bit of humor is the real possibility we
could elect this dangerous demagogue President.  And that's no joke.
