In his "Nattering Nabobs", Victor Carli conflated complaints about
Secretary Clinton's handling of official emails with the election-time
hacking of campaign-related emails.  When I point out the difference,
his response is the confounding, "I never used the word 'server', so
how could I hack it?"  Can he at least hack the truth?

He entirely misunderstands my pointing out that Trump's Electoral
College win is in the bottom 25%, claiming that I say that a landslide
must be in the top 25%.  That's not what I said, but actually, that's
not a stringent enough standard.  Certainly the 56.5% of the electors
Trump won doesn't qualify.  This was not a landslide.

He complains that I left out part of his letter in my response.  Of
course I did.  I ignored the irrelevancies.  But if he wants a
response: no I don't think that the American public has rights to the
candidates' internal deliberations.

On the question of patriotism, I would ask that of anyone who could
write, "If we assume that the emails were hacked by Russians, that
information is irrelevant and unimportant."

Mr. Carli concludes "Truth is omnipotent; you should try it sometime."
 The election of Donald Trump has demonstrated that this is fantasy.
Truth too can be the victim of a smear campaign.

Briefly, to Chip Hale: it would be better that we enshrine one person,
one vote into law, electing the popular vote winner.  The end-run is
not around the Constitution, which does not mandate winner-take all
nor mandate that electors pay attention to what voters choose.  The
end-run is around the current broken system.  If we can fix it with an
amendment, we should, as we've done by electing Senators directly.
This is just another chance to expand our democracy.
