Donald Trump no longer wants to be called "Mr. President."  He would prefer "His
Royal Highness, first of his name, Protector of the States, the Commonwealths,
and the Territories of the United States (except Puerto Rico)."  In less formal
settings, "King Donald" is permissible.

His lawyers sent a letter to Special Counsel Mueller; it's very simply a claim
that Donald Trump is above the law.  In fact, I'm told that if you heat each
page of it, you can see written in lemon juice, "L'etat c'est moi."

(How this letter leaked is an interesting story.  It seems that by opening and
closing curtains in West Wing rooms, one can create a slow but effective version
of Morse code.  Extensive calculations have shown that three weeks is just long
enough to send the 7300 word memo with 2500 words of footnotes, and still have
time for a pedicure.  I'm just asking, but where has Melania been lately?)

Seriously though, our so-called President is claiming that he cannot obstruct an
investigation, because no matter his motives, no matter the facts, the
Constitution says he's the boss and can order the investigation stopped and/or
pardon anyone it investigates.  His latest lawyer claims that he can pardon
himself: essentially the president is so far above the law that he could "stand
in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody" and not face any consequences.
Perhaps his lawyers read too many of his campaign speeches?

Fortunately, our Constitution stands in his way.  It is extremely wary of ceding
great power to any institutions, especially executive power. While Congress has
slowly ceded much of its power to the Presidency, it has not managed to put him
above the law.  In November we can elect a Congress with enough spine to tell
Mr. Trump so.
