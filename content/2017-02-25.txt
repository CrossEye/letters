A few weeks ago Sam Prentice said that by not electing Hillary Clinton we had
dodged a bullet.  If so, we dodged right into the path of a speeding locomotive.

Our so-called president declared the news media the enemy of the people.  He
called reporters "scum" and "terrible people".  Surrogate (or is he actually the
principle?) Steve Bannon named the news media the opposition.  Now they're
barring reporters they don't like from press briefings.

This is starting to look less and less like the America I know and love.

We have a cabinet full of unqualified people, many opposed to the very missions
of their departments.  We have officeholders who lie repeatedly and publicly
gripe when they're caught at it.  We have senior advisers promoting "alternative
facts" and imaginary attacks. We have a Senate leader who for a year refused to
do one of the Senate's most important jobs but lambastes the opposition for
considering any delay in that job now.  We have a House majority so full of
cowardice that its leader briefly appeared on the Wikipedia page for
invertebrates (http://bit.ly/RyanSpineless).

Donald Trump's routine of bullying others while whining about being mistreated
is the very opposite of leadership.  Five weeks into office and he's caused so
much harm to America that we'll be lucky to recover inside a generation.

The bullet would be better.
