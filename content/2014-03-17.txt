This is a letter I've wanted to write for a while. But every time I go to take
up my pen, some idiocy by Bamboozled Buffoon or one of the Randroids needs
answering instead. Finally, here goes:

All liberals should be outraged by the NSA spying revelations that continue to
pour in. We need to let our representatives in Congress know that this needs to
stop. And we need to let President Obama know just how disappointed we are that
the president we expected to bring about sweeping liberal reforms -- a
Constitutional scholar to boot -- could not recognize the gross betrayal of
trust engendered in his sanctioning of these programs.

Our government has no right to spy on its citizens. It's really that simple.
Absent a clear and present threat, the people have the simple right to be left
alone.

Any claims about the programs collecting mere metadata ignores the fact that a
great wealth of individual information can be gleaned from the metadata. (See
the recent report at http://bit.ly/1kYKFvY for more information.)

I'm glad to see that the opposition is not just from liberals, but from
conservatives as well. But I do wonder a little about their motives. Those who
supported the PATRIOT act are reaping their just rewards in these new programs.
Nonetheless, welcome to the fight. Let's see if together we can abolish this
reprehensible intrusion of the government into our lives.
