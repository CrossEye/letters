Is it Monsanto?  Dupont?  Someone is breeding a new strain of fact-resistant
humans.  These GOP-modified organisms can repel all truths.  For instance,
exposure to the Fox News Virus creates anaphylactic reactions to the science of
global warming.

Sometimes the mechanisms are clear.  The CDC was instructed to avoid certain
words, ones like "science-based", "evidence-based" and "diversity".  The story
is quite new, and Mr. Trump's minions will likely change their tune.  Still,
they did this.  They actually did this.  They brought Orwell's nightmare to
life.

(When the physiks asked to heal Sir Donald's apoplexy bleed him to remove the
bad humours, will he appreciate as he dies that they avoided "evidence-based"
medicine?)

Usually it's difficult to understand how these specimens avoid the truth.  Is it
exposure to *e coli johngaltium* that made Sam Prentice ignore that the federal
government's "mass killing" is different from "mass shootings" and that since
there's no official definition, any statistics about "mass shootings" are
suspect?

This same specimen claims that the CFPB is "beyond the control of any
constitutional authority".  Presented with five separate constitutional checks
on it, he simply describes ways in which it's unchecked.  The facts leave him
untouched!

Interestingly, these fact shields don't affect rumor and innuendo. Mr. Prentice
repeats already refuted stories about Elizabeth Warren. Based on family lore,
she has claimed Native American heritage. There is no evidence she ever touted
this on a job or school application or that anyone was harmed by it.

What is this mysterious mechanism immunizing modern Conservatives against the
truth?  Did they crossbreed strains of Barry Goldwater with the Charles Ponzi
line?  Did they isolate the Robert Taft gene and somehow redact the Honest Abe
one?

This needs to stop.  Democratic society needs citizens who prefer the truth over
lies, who actually practice critical thinking.
