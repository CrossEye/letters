Again, Sam Prentice seems to have little grasp on the subject he presents in his
letter. (Anyone for another dose of how global warming is a conspiracy of
liberals to take over the economy?) He seems to want to draw a sharp distinction
between liberals and progressive, one that means little to those of us on that
side of the fence, who are generally comfortable with either term. He seems to
have little knowledge of what liberalism has meant in America. Perhaps a little
history lesson is in order.

When the American colonies declared independence from England and fought a war
to support it, the conservatives were the ones who favored maintaining their
status as colonists. It was liberals who wanted a change.

When the issue was slavery, the abolitionists were the liberals; those promoting
slavery were the conservatives.

Those who supported the rights of workers to create trade-unions and bargain
collectively were liberals, fighting against the powerful conservative business
interests.

The women's suffrage movement was a liberal cause, opposed by the conservative
establishment.

The civil rights movement against segregation was a movement of liberals
fighting a violent conservative backlash.

Those promoting the women's rights movement were the liberals; those opposing it
were the conservatives.

Liberals are the downtrodden, the powerless, and those sympathetic with them.
They are sometimes the majority, sometimes not, but they are never some small
cadre of elite that Sam Prentice likes to imagine. And time and again, it is the
liberals who are on the right side of history.
