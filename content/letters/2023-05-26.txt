Sam Prentice defends Tony Heller from charges of being a charlatan.  Heller runs
the blog https://realclimatescience.com/, rated Conspiracy-Pseudoscience and
Quakery (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/).  It's possible
Heller is not a charlatan.  If he believes the nonsense he's peddling, he's not
a charlatan, only a badly informed menace.  Still, he convinces the gullible
that he understands NASA's and NOAA's data better than NASA and NOAA; he
*sounds* like a charlatan. 

Mr. Prentice says I never back up my claims and in the next sentence complains
about URLs I post.  Sam, those *are* evidence backing up my claims!  I use
easy-to-type URLS in my letters.  For instance, I created a link to the
fact-check above.  Now you can type just http://link.sauyet.com/77.  If you
don't trust these, you can now append "/preview" to them.  Visiting
http://link.sauyet.com/77/preview, you'll see the actual URL and can decide
whether to click the link.

Prentice's letter -- falsely chiding me for not providing evidence -- itself
provides no evidence.  Don't you love irony?  Let's examine one of his claims:
that Joe Biden is the worst president in history.  This is opinion, but there
are actual experts who rank presidents.  I know only one poll covering Biden,
from Sienna College in 2022 (overview: http://link.sauyet.com/78, data:
http://link.sauyet.com/79), ranking Biden number 19, in the top half.  Trump, by
contrast, is 43rd out of 45.  The other surveys covering Trump place him 41st,
42nd, and last.  (Details: http://letters.sauyet.com/#/2023-05-26).  While Sam
Prentice sees Biden as the worst, experts see him as above average and see Trump
among the worst.  Evidence!

I respond to Prentice's ridiculous outbursts on climate because this is today's
defining crisis.  I want my grandchildren to inherit a livable world.  We're on
a path away from that.  The nonsense that Heller promotes and Prentice parrots
could keep us from finding a better path.

Three more presidential ranking polls:

  * [New York Times, 2018][nyt]
  * Sienna College, 2018, [overview][sc18o], and [data][sc18d]
  * [C-Span, 2021][csp]

These are all I could find from reputable sources.  There may be others.
