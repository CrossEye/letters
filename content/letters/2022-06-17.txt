Our local right-wing correspondents see the losing battle on gun control and the
rapidly deteriorating status of Donald Trump and want to change the subject.
They go for an oldie-but-a-goody: global warming.  To understand their
suggestions, you must learn something we might call Prentice logic.

Sam Prentice recently demonstrated this, suggesting that increasing CO2 levels
are beneficial, since plants need it.  Other instances of this "more of a good
thing" theory:  Since one beer is good to drink, a few cases must be much
better.  If a gallon of distilled water in the fridge is good, then flooding the
kitchen with water can only be an improvement.  Eight hours of sleep a day is
good for your health; twenty hours can only make you healthier.  Absurdities,
all.

He suggests we read the blog of science denier Tony Heller (aka Steven Goddard)
to learn about his imagined conspiracy of scientists, journalists, politicians,
and others -- who seem to be after mind-control or some such.  To learn about
this site, visit the review from the media bias checker at
https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/, which rates it
"conspiracy-pseudoscience", with  a "Moderate" conspiracy rating and a
"Quackery" pseudo-science level.  It was presumably named so that it could be
mistaken for the excellent https://www.realclimate.org/, which is "pro-science",
with the highest rating for factual reporting
(https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/realclimate/.)

I applaud Mr. Prentice for listing some sources, but pointing to a shoddy,
meaningless site that happens to agree with one's bias is hardly a powerful
argument.

And then there's the logic of suggesting that the party of death is *not* the
party in favor of gun proliferation, the party rejecting infant formula relief,
the party that led us into unwinnable wars in the Middle East, but instead the
party that opposed all this.

Prentice logic is... quite interesting, no?
