Marcie Miner is running for Andover BOE.  It's like clockwork: every May, she
writes an inflammatory and misleading letter about our school budget.  Let's
look back.

  * May, 2021: She claimed the per-pupil costs were mysterious, despite the
  budget being presented publicly in meetings and videos.

  * May, 2022: She said the board was "hoarding cash" and "placing our children
  in the middle", as if education budgets aren't supposed to be about children.
  (http://link.sauyet.com/mm22)

  * May 2023: She accused the board of "picking your pocket", even though
  Andover's expenditures are below the state average.
  (http://link.sauyet.com/mm23)

  * May 2024: She called the budget "inflated," ignoring that costs (utilities,
  salaries, insurance) and enrollment were rising. (http://link.sauyet.com/mm24)

  * May 2025: She claimed that town officials knew better how to manage school
  capital expenses, even though no one there has such experience.

It makes one wonder when Marcie Miner last approved of a school budget.  When
her kids were there?  

Her comments sound strikingly similar to the scurrilous, anonymous flyer about
school finances from last spring -- the one The Rivereast apologized for
distributing, due to falsehoods. At the time, I suspected she was involved.
Rereading her letters, you'll find the parallels impossible to ignore.  If you
are interested in corrections to the flyer's lies, and to Ms. Miner's points,
you can find them on https://flyer.andoverct.info/.

OK, people are allowed to vent, even when they're wrong.  But now she's running
for the Board of Education.  That puts a very different spin on things.  Does
she know that under Connecticut's Minimum Budget Requirement, towns can't
recklessly cut school funding?  Or that Andover's per-pupil spending is lower
than nine of the ten districts closest in size to Andover?

Though elected by the town, BOE members are also legal agents of the state,
responsible for the appropriate education of our children.  We do not need a
Board member whose primary focus would be on slashing budgets, even to the
detriment of the children.  There are four candidates running for the BOE.  The
other three are well qualified.  If you want to vote for a Republican, by all
means, choose the cross-endorsed Sharon St. Rock on the Republican line.  That
will be my own first Republican vote in the Trump era.  

Let's not add obstacles to the already difficult task of responsible budgeting.
We need Board members who support our schools, not undermine them.
