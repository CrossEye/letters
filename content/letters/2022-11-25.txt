Bonnie Olivieri tells us we're uninformed because we disagree with her, that
we're ignorantly voting to extend our most significant problems. That's not how
it works. Her pressing issues are very different from mine. I would likely
vehemently disagree with her votes, but I will do her the courtesy of not
implying that she's stupid for them. I wish she would do the same for others.

She thinks our most important problems are:

  * Inflation – mostly out of politicians' control, related to overheated
  economies and oil shocks; now coming down now after spiking when the economy
  improved so rapidly in 2021 and 2022.

  * Immigration – with the ongoing labor shortage and rapid wage growth, if Ms.
  Olivieri would like lower inflation, she should appreciate a larger supply of
  cheap labor. Very little fentanyl or sex trafficking is tied to illegal
  immigrants.
  
  * CRT in schools – this (obviously correct) subject is taught in law schools,
  not primary and secondary schools.
  
  * Rampant crime – The spike in crime starting in 2019 is barely a blip on
  thirty years of falling crime.
    
To me, our most pressing problems are far worse:

  * The ongoing climate crisis, making our world much less livable.

  * The devolution of a major American political party into anarchy and
  antidemocratic authoritarianism.

Voting for the opposition would simply exacerbate these dangerous problems.

I agree that people could be helped by looking at better news media. Rather than television news, try sources like these: The New York Times, The National Review, The Washington Post, the Christian Science Monitor, The Atlantic, NPR, The New Yorker, The Hartford Courant, The Wall Street Journal.

Briefly: It's endearing that Ed Kozlowski thinks my "report cards" implied I was
acting like a college professor. I was thinking grade school teacher, myself.
