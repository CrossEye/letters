I must thank Sam Prentice for clearly demonstrating my point.

I said those discussing "mainstream media" falsely imply they have access to
highly credible, overlooked news sources.  His response claims the mainstream
media "collude with one another to provide fabricated party-line narratives
while embargoing anything portraying contrary information."  There we have it.
Thank you, Mr. Prentice.

This merely pretends his ideology is not thoroughly contradicted by the facts.
There's absolutely no substance.  

He speaks passionately about the death of Ashli Babbitt.  As I recall, he has
never written to condemn the police for their many killings of unarmed black
men.  There have been quite a few of those lately.  Perhaps you've noticed?  Is
this because of race?  Because of gender?  Or is it simply because he sees
assaulting our Capitol in order to overturn an election as a much less heinous
crime than selling loose cigarettes, having a broken taillight, or walking in
one's grandmother's backyard.

I do not condone her killing.  Police killings should be extremely rare; this
situation wasn't dire enough.  But it was a close call.  I agree with the
Justice Department's decision not to charge the officer
(http://link.sauyet.com/20).  However Mr. Prentice's whitewashing is beyond
absurd.  He says she was "surrounded by officers who could have arrested her at
any time" when the video clearly shows her to be the first through the barricade
between the insurrectionists and the police protecting members of Congress.

I did label her "seditionist".  Perhaps that wasn't fair.  I'm sure most people
violently attacking our government center -- busting doors, assaulting police,
threatening the lives of Senators and Representatives, in order to prevent the
legal transfer of power -- I'm sure many such people are perfectly nice and on
most days would never even *consider* trying to overthrow our government.
