My series of letters on progressive beliefs sparked some response.

Daniel Colby wrote the very sort of letter that prompted my series, an insulting
description of what progressivism is from the outside, without any real
understanding. It would be the equivalent of me -- a dyed-in-the-wool liberal --
explaining what conservatives believe, insulting them all the while. If instead
of philosophy, he wants to discuss history, I&#39;m more than willing to compare
the liberal leaders of our land against the conservative ones. But that&#39;s a
different discussion.

Don Denley finds it difficult to distinguish between looking for a handout
and preventing the powerful from abusing those without power. It&#39;s really
not complicated.

Sam Prentice, who really should know better, does not distinguish between
inequality in outcomes and inequality of opportunity. Should we really be rating
the quality of input of three- year olds before deciding that the ones from rich
families deserve so much better chances than the others?

Unsurprisingly, Chuck Corso used a lot of words to say very little. Parody is a
mixture of three things: understanding the original material, altering it in a
satirical or ironic tone, and making the results amusing. Sorry, Mr. Corso,
three strikes again. Let me respond to just one point: Conservatives continually
bemoan the fact that academia and journalism are bastions of liberalism. But
turn it around for a second. What does it say about conservatism that the most
intelligent and the most knowledgeable members of our society are liberals?

Ryan Gritter does understand the use of satire, and I absolutely love his modest
proposal. Unfortunately, I must gratefully decline the invitation to join his
contest. It would hardly be fair to pit my meager talents against the repeated
winner of the Windbag Olympics.
