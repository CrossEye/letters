From Ed Kozlowski: "Apparently present-day liberals ignore the history of the
Southern Democrats, plantations, and the inception of the KKK."

Apparently, Ed Kozlowski does not understand the difference between political
persuasion and party affiliation. Most of us present-day liberals easily
recognize that Jim Crow and America's horrifying history of racial strife was
for decades concentrated in the Democratic party. Do you think we should care?
Today, that ideology is dominant in the Republican party. The "party of Lincoln"
has undergone many changes in fundamental ideology over its history, swinging
between concern for property and concern for equality. The pendulum currently
favors property. (See Heather Cox Richardson's _To Make Men Free_ for details.)
Currently there is more room for liberal ideas in the Democratic Party, so
that's where we've been most active.

I'm afraid there has been a change over the last few decades, especially over
the last four years. The Republican party has enabled the misbehavior of the
most corrupt, most incompetent, and, I'm willing to say, the most evil president
our country has ever seen.

Our answer is simple. We are going to have to adopt some partisanship. For the
next few years, we are going to refuse to vote for *any* Republican who does not
publicly and loudly disavow Donald Trump and all he stands for. Not for
President. Not for Senator, Governor, School Board, or Dogcatcher. We're not
alone. The Lincoln Project, the Bulwark, Republican Voters Against Trump, and
others show that this is still not coming from a narrow ideological group. This
is widespread disgust.

Republican candidates, please be on notice. We have not before been particularly
partisan. But Trump has pushed us that way. Now we need to hear you denounce
Trump and all he stands for, or we will actively work against your election.
