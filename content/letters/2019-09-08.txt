(Part 2 of a short series on scientists opposing the global warming consensus.
Last week: notes on science.)

Dan Armstrong cites two papers.  The first (http://bit.ly/clouds-warm), from
Finland's Turku University claims climate models ignore the effect of cloud
coverage.  This paper is not peer-reviewed, citing few sources beyond the
authors' own (often unpublished) research.  They don't explain their data or
methods. Essentially they note a correlation, then assert without evidence that
cloud cover causes warming rather than the reverse.  A professional rebuttal is
at  http://bit.ly/warm-clouds.

The second (http://bit.ly/svenmark) seems a legitimate paper, but I couldn't
follow it entirely (I'm Scientific American-level science literate, not
Nature-level!)  What I did gather is that Earth's periodic magnetic field
reversal correlates to the glacial cycle.  I see little here contradicting
anthropogenic global warming; perhaps someone better at climatology can
enlighten me.

Mr. Armstrong also quotes scientists. Ivar Giaever said, "Global warming has
become a new religion."  Yes, there are skeptics.  In a world that appreciates
curiosity and freedom of expression, there always will be.

But if you heard that Joe Torre criticized the way Bill Belicheck arranged his
plays, you would listen politely; his obvious expertise coaching baseball
affords him some respect.  But he's not a football coach; we cannot assume his
expertise transfers.   Dr. Giaever is a Nobel-prize winning physicist; we should
listen respectfully to his scientific comments.  But a retired professor of
physics is not a likely contributor to climatology.  Moreover, his affiliation
with the anti-science Heartland Institute makes his pronouncements questionable.
This think tank plainly lets ideology and funding drive its science, rejecting
the tobacco/cancer link and fighting the global warming consensus.  Listen
politely to Dr. Giaever, but don't count on his understanding or objectivity.

This goes double for mathematician David Evans and retired chemist Les Woodcock.

(Next week: more scientists.)
