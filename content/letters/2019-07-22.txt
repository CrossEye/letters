Global warming is the most severe threat facing society in generations, but
there are reasons for hope.  This is not the fingers-in-the-ears hope promoted
by our global warming deniers. (Really, how many times can one person, when his
points are solidly refuted with citations to relevant research, simply repeat
those same points?)  Instead, it involves real reasons to believe people around
the world can successfully fight climate change.

The best they can do, though, is mitigate the issues.  Barring some unlikely --
by no means impossible! -- technological breakthrough, the world will continue
to warm for decades, causing us many serious problems.  But the global response
to this crisis has made the worst outcomes less likely.  Here are some of the
things happening:

  - Today's youth are leading the charge against global warming.  When
they come to power, we will have forces dedicating to fixing the problem rather
than ignoring it.  Young leaders like Greta Thunberg show us the way.

  - Renewable energy is improving rapidly, cheaper now than coal, and
catching up to natural gas.

  - Groups as diverse as the environmental community, the insurance
industry, and the military are working to deal with the effects of climate
change.  This is not a fringe movement.  It's the clear mainstream.

  - Despite the absence of leadership from the US government, our
states and cities are taking up the mantle.

  - Donald Trump's impetuosity has not led other countries to abandon
climate agreements.

  - The mitigation effort has usually been a net economic benefit.
San Francisco substantially cut greenhouse emissions while its population grew
20% and its economy grew 110%.

I don't suggest that things are rosy.  This is the defining crisis of our world.
It will get worse before it gets better.  However, it's important to recognize
the positive aspects.
