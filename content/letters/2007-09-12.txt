The Andover Website Committee is looking for volunteers.  A recent letter to the
editor noted that the Andover Website is not always updated with the latest
minutes from meetings and the latest schedule changes.  This is quite true, and
the Website Committee would love help in fixing the problem.  Would you be
willing to spend an hour or two per month helping us out?

We are looking for volunteers to help steer the direction of the town's website,
to help update the content on the site, to help improve its usability and
reliability, and to help organize the efforts of other volunteers.  We don't
need any particular skills, just a willingness to help.  Of course if you have
any website design or development skills, we'd love to have you too!

The website is run entirely by volunteers.  We'd like to see some significant
improvements to the site, but that can only be accomplished if there are people
in town committed to helping.  Please, come join our team.  You can reach us via
email at webmaster@andoverct.org.  Or you can call Scott Sauyet at 742-9800.  Or
simply come to our next meeting at 7:00 on September 24 in the school library.
