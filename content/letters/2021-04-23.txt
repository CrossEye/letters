Peter Kushowski counters my description of "mainstream media" with a dictionary
definition.  That would be legitimate, except I described how the phrase is
actually used, a haughty claim of superiority over those who don't share one's
overlooked news sources.  It's a form of condescending arrogance.  While
"mainstream media" *could* suggest dominant news trends, in practice it's a
snide put-down of those trends.

Mr. Kushowski demonstrates this very issue: insinuating that the dominant trend
in news coverage of the BLM protests -- peaceful and thoughtful activism -- is
burying the reality of "anarchist looting and burning."  How much violence did
he witness directly?  Did he travel to Minneapolis or Portland?  Did protesters
pelt him with water bottles?  Did he take police truncheons to the face?  Or did
he simply consume a limited set of sources with axes to grind?

Popularity does not imply quality, but the reversal implicit in "mainstream
media" is absurd.  Something is not more believable because Newsmax or Daily
Caller buck the consensus claimimg it.  Outlets such as The New York Times, The
Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and NPR subscribe to a code that truth
is more important than sensationalism or ideology.  Unfortunately, it's
different with the advocacy journalism of Fox and MSNBC, more so with outlets
such as Breitbart, TownHall, or Vox.  While one can bemoan the recent
bothsidesism at NYT or NPR, they are still far more reliable sources than, say,
Fox.

Regarding those protests, one side has stories meant to enrage; the other has
facts.  The best summary is ACLED's September report
(http://link.sauyet.com/18), which notes that of the 10,600 protests, 10,100 of
them reported no violence or damage.  The total property damage eclipsed the
1992 disturbances, but with the largest protest movement in U.S. history this is
unsurprising.  This was a peaceful movement.
