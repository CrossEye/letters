Jon Turban correctly diagnoses racist undertones in recent letters, but his cure
is worse than the disease.  "Giving someone a platform to expose openly racist
language [...] has no place in society."  No.  The marketplace of ideas is
central to a free society.  Even morons spouting drivel must be tolerated.  In
dialog and mutual critique we discover truth.

How does this apply to Ed Kozlowski's latest boogeyman, Neil Young?  Isn't his
Spotify ultimatum -- Joe Rogan or Young -- an unacceptable deplatforming?  Well
no.  When Twitter suspended Trump's account for violating its terms, fans quit
Twitter in protest.  They were perfectly justified.  The same holds for Neil
Young.  If a platform offends you, whether by suspending your hero's access or
by hosting Covid misinformation promoters, then you can withhold your approval,
your attention, or your music catalog.  It doesn't repudiate the marketplace of
ideas; it's how that marketplace functions.  Personally, I'm with Jill
Filipovic, who said Spotify "should draw the line at dangerous life-threatening
conspiracy theories."

Mr. Kozlowski's remaining letter is a monstrous waste.  First he paints the
Reaganite Neil Young as a hero of Progressivism, then bashes Young for an old
homophobic statement, and parrots bits of a ridiculous conspiracy theory
involving Young selling music rights to Hipgnosis (great name!), Blackstone's
later investment, their hiring a former Pfizer executive, suppression of
anti-vaxx information, and, likely, Elvis and space aliens. Such idiocy is
increasingly the enterprise of the right.

...I just read Jonathan Rauch's *The Constitution of Knowledge*, which discusses
how we determine truth: in science, in economics, in politics.  He breaks little
new ground, but it's a wonderful synthesis of ideas from Hobbes to Locke and
Madison, to Trumpian disinformation and modern cancel culture.  The marketplace
of ideas is a central concerns.  I highly recommend it.
