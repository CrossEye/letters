Donald Trump has taught his disciples an important technique: never admit the
lie; treat your audience like idiots, repeating it until they stop arguing.
People like Sam Prentice took this to heart.  In three previous letters (details
at [http://letters.sauyet.com/#/pages/democracy][lp]), I have corrected his "not
a democracy, but a republic" falshood.  But he repeats it again.

He shares the familiar Benjamin Franklin story, conveniently ignoring the
question asked: "Doctor, what have we got? A republic or a monarchy?", which
gives context for "A Republic, if you can keep it."  That's the point.
Webster's definition of *republic* is, "a government having a chief of state who
is not a monarch and who in modern times is usually a president."  So, yes,
we're a republic.

Webster's definition of *democracy*: "a government in which the supreme power is
vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a
system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections."
So guess what?  We're a democracy too.  If Mr. Prentice wants to deny that we're
also a representative democracy, he really needs to explain why the definition
doesn't apply.

That "democracy" doesn't appear in the Constitution means no more than the fact
that "republican" is used only regarding the states.  As much as Sam Prentice
wants to deny it, the constitution requires interpretation.  If he wants to
stick to textualism, how would he rebut the contention that the Supreme Court
has no authority to strike down Connecticut gun laws.  After all, there is no
reference to judicial review in the Constitution.  There's no enumerated power
to strike down federal laws, let alone state ones.

Nothing else in his fanciful letter -- or in Ed Kozlowski's perpetual nonsense
-- is worth rebutting, except to note that Mr. Prentice has clearly not read the
actual Mueller report.
