A few weeks ago a letter exclaimed that "We Want Our Country Back!" Our flag, it
said, "is sacred and must be respected."  The writer and I have very different
ideas on what "sacred" means, and very different ideas about respect.

This letter suggests we should pass a law (according the Supreme Court it would
have to be a Constitutional Amendment) to prevent desecration of the flag, and
says we should make the Pledge of Allegiance mandatory in schools.

Ridiculous!

Our flag is a symbol of our nation, of the experiment in self-government so
successful it's been copied around the world.  It's a symbol of a country that
takes its freedoms seriously, including our freedom of expression, our freedom
to choose our leaders, our freedom to challenge those leaders and petition them
for redress of grievances.  It's a symbol of a people strong and resilient.

But it's only a symbol.  A law as described would put the symbol ahead of the
people and their freedoms that the flag symbolizes.  Does the writer love the
flag more than the freedom-loving country it represents?  Is she in favor of our
government of the people, by the people, an for the people? Because enforcing a
pledge to a flag is the mark of an authoritarian regime, not of a democracy.

There were several other odd points in the letter, but this one deserves a
response:  She says that immigrants must learn our language and traditions.  It
seems to me that just as with every previous group of immigrants in our history,
the first generation starts to adapt, and the second one becomes nearly fully
assimilated.  This is the way it's always gone.

I don't know who she wants the country back from, but to my eyes, it's still in
pretty good hands: ours.
