Don Denley generously offers to pay one third the cost of a crying towel for me.

It's a tempting offer. There is much to weep about after the recent election:
the fact that 46% of American voters could support an incompetent bully, or the
fact that as presumed President-elect, Donald Trump is stumbling around the
international arena, upending foreign relations because he doesn't know any
better and won't listen to advice.

But no, Mr. Denley should keep his money. He's likely to need it. History shows
that our economy fairs significantly better under Democrats than Republicans. By
the time Mr. Bankruptcy is through, our wallets might take as big a beating as
our civil rights.

I first tussled with Don Denley on these pages years ago over lies he told while
a candidate for local office. Somehow it's no surprise that he supports a
politician who doesn't know the difference between lies and the truth.

Speaking of the truth, Sam Prentice needs to pay attention to actual news. He's
not finding truth from his current sources. Stating that "progressives have a
monopoly on the hatred exhibited in this election cycle" displays such
staggering ignorance that it might have been said by Donald Trump himself. For
refutation, one can read Mr. Trump's Twitter page or Breitbart.

Regarding the vote itself, Mr. Prentice complains that supporters of the
candidate who handily won the overall vote are looking for the electors to
fulfill their responsibility. Many would prefer to see the Electoral College be
replaced by pure democracy. Failing that, we'd like the electors to do their
duty: protect us from a potential autocrat. Sam Prentice objects to this, but
doesn't decry an actual candidate who refused to abide by the election results
unless he won. And he accuses the Democrats of hypocrisy?
