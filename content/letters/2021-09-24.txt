They're at it again. The right-wing contributors to these pages are not just
promulgating lies; we've been used to that for a long time. No, they are also
trying to kill us.

Forty years ago, their brethren were explaining that tobacco use is an
individual choice, that your desire to avoid the fumes and live longer could not
trump their freedom to smoke on that crowded bus. In recent years
they have blocked efforts to forestall the environmental crisis.  Preventing
environmental breakdown is just too costly, they would say, so we'll just 
poison the planet for our children.

Both of these can be understood as the right being shills, willing or not, for
certain industries. But the current objection to public health measures such as
vaccines and masks is a different beast. They've descended to pure nihilism,
treating as gurus snake-oil salesmen.  (Quite literally: see
https://nyti.ms/3CxriEw.)

A recent quote from Nobel winning economist, Paul Krugman, captures this
perfectly:

"I never thought I’d be nostalgic for the era when big money ruled the right.
But traditional corporate influence looks benign compared with where we are now.
At this point, to be a conservative in good standing you have to pledge
allegiance to blatant lies — Democrats are Marxists, the election was stolen,
basic public health measures are sinister assaults on freedom."

There's little to add to that. The right has simply gone crazy. The big question
is whether their insanity will bring down our country.

This forum is far too short for well-researched answers to the Covid
nonsense, but I have posted answers to Carol Johnson, Gary Gile, and Sam
Prentice on http://letters.sauyet.com/#/covid.  I will try to keep it updated
to counter the ongoing nonsense.
