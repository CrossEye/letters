I have to admit I find it rather amusing. Peter Kushowski claims the media was
pushing a fake reality of mostly peaceful protests and ignoring what he saw as
the reality of anarchist looting and burning. When I reply that the research
backs up these "fake reality" accounts, Victor Bonanno chides me for not noting
the media's depictions of violence.

They need to get their story straight. What I'm hearing is that the media is
presenting a violent, destructive, mostly peaceful movement. Hmmm.

Mr. Bonanno does get one thing right: I do not own a TV. (Technically I do, but
with no antenna or cable, it's just a device for playing DVDs, streaming
Netflix, etc.) I get my news from newspapers, magazines, radio, and the
Internet. What I learned from these sources was that this was the most
widespread protest movement in US history; that the movement was a sincere
attempt to change a culture of police brutality, especially towards black men;
that there were numerous incidents of violence, looting, and burning; that a
frightening amount of the violence was perpetrated by the police on unarmed
protesters; that another significant portion of it was created by
counter-protesters; that the total property damage was high; that the former guy
in the White House and allies tried to spin this as an anarchist, violent
movement; that perhaps six percent of the events had any associated violence or
property damage.

There were around forty protests in Connecticut during this time. The only
incident of violence I recall was when a car drove into the crowd of protesters
and some protesters confronted the driver about it. Of course we saw the
violence across the country, and of course there was a lot of it, but it
involved a small fraction of the overall movement.
