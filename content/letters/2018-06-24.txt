Dan Armstrong has been singing the praises of free markets.  There is much to be
said for them, but they are not a panacea.  Let's look at some of the downsides
to free markets.

There are many ways in which markets do not provide what society deems
appropriate.  Let's start with what we market.  A regulation-free economy would
allow the unscrupulous to provide slaves. It would allow child labor.  It would
allow lead paint in children's toys.  It could not demand truthful advertising
or require accurate ingredient labels. To say that we would fix these flaws by
law is already to distort free markets.

Free markets provide many goods and services, but there are many others they
cannot provide.  How about public goods, such as courts, the military,
firefighters, police, roads?  There is no incentive for an individual to pay for
them, so there is no incentive for someone to sell them.  Do free-market
worshipers think we should just do without them?

And what about when economic exchanges adversely affects someone other than the
participants, known as "negative externalities"?  A free market offers little
ways to prevent industrial pollution, to inhibit overfishing, to avoid
antibiotic resistant pathogens.

Free markets also face power imbalances.  How bad would cell service be and how
high would prices be in five years if Verizon bought all its major competitors
today?  When the trust-busters broke up Standard Oil or AT&T, they were helping
consumers, who had no power of their own.

Perhaps the greatest problem in free markets is that they recognize only the
value of money.  If something does not have a price, it is not considered
valuable.  Things such as ethical standards have no price-point, so the free
markets reject them.  Uninhibited free markets can have a corrosive effect on
our entire society.
