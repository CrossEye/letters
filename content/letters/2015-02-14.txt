Bill Desrosiers hits a very important point. While Joe Stevens' regular notes
serve as an important counterbalance to the idiocy penned by Mr. Corso's
intellectual ilk, I do wish he would stop painting all conservatives with the
same brush. There are good people of all political persuasions.

The conservative policies of politicians and zealots are fair game. Those who
promote the military over social services, who fight for more prisons and police
and against immigrants and public education, those who do so loudly in the
public forum -- those folks deserve a sustained and vocal response. But let's
not pretend that this represents everyone who calls themselves conservative. I
have strong feelings about this, as I'm often the one responding to Sam
Prentice's anti-progressive diatribes.

On to Mr. Corso.

Chuck Corso had the temerity to blame the President -- who inherited the worst
conditions since the Great Depression -- when the economy was doing poorly, but
not the grace to credit him when it's doing well. He specifically called out the
President on high gasoline prices, denying that external forces were a critical
factor. Now that prices are improved, Mr. Corso is willing to credit only those
forces. On all other points, he ignores or contradicts figures easily checked.

I maintained then and still maintain that Presidential policies have little to
do with short-term economic outcomes: they can help steer around crises and set
the country on its long-term path. On quarterly or annual economic numbers, any
President has limited influence.

Chuck Corso is simply braying stale talking points from Fox's talking heads. I
remember when the right had some intellectual heft. Can you imagine what William
Safire or William F. Buckley, Jr. would make of Mr. Corso's sophistry?
