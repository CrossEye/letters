I have two lists and a question.

The first list is of leaders from around the world who helped bring democracy to
their nations or saw their country through a major crisis in its democracy.  The
names are all familiar: India's Mohandas Gandhi, Britain's Winston Churchill,
South Africa's Nelson Mandela, and the U.S.'s Franklin Roosevelt.  If you
choose, you can also throw in some of the U.S. founders such as Thomas Jefferson
and James Madison.

The second list is of leaders who oversaw their country's descent from democracy
into a more autocratic government.  These names should also mostly be familiar:
Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, Germany's Adolph Hitler, Italy's Benito Mussolini,
Argentina's Juan Perón, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and Hungary's Viktor Orbán.
Each of these leaders gained power through democratic institutions and then
corrupted or destroyed those institutions.

My question is simple: Does Donald Trump seem more likely to be listed in the
first list of the second?

I'm afraid the answer is extremely disheartening for our country.
