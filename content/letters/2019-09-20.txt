(Part 4 and conclusion of a short series on scientists opposing the global
warming consensus.  Last week: Robert Laughlin, Judith Curry, John T. Reid, and
Petr Ch√Ωlek.)

Finally, Dan Armstrong discusses Leonard Weinstein.  I've tried determining his
credentials: if the blogs are correct, his advanced degrees are in Engineering
and his specialty is aeronautics/astronautics, not climatology.  The only
articles I found were two Google Docs from 2009 (http://bit.ly/weinstein-1 and
http://bit.ly/weintstein-2).  They are not peer-reviewed, discuss only
atmospheric heat, and try to debunk statements never published.  But the biggest
issue I see is that his projections assume the entire 20th century's output of
CO2 acreted linearly.  When you factor in the accelerating rate, his results are
meaningless.

I'm sure Mr. Armstrong can add additional names; most would likely be similar,
either non-experts chiming in or experts saying something different than the
contrarians claim.  There are legitimate climate scientists who disagree with
the consensus; that's how science works. However most climate skeptics are
coming at it backward: "it will be difficult to react to climate change, so
let's fund a study to pretend it's not happening."

What bothers me about the climate skeptic community is not the obvious
conspiracy theory mentality; that's no longer noteworthy.  It's not the
scientific illiteracy; that's regrettable but understood.  What bothers me is
the smugness of a group that thinks it has inside information everyone else is
too brainwashed to recognize.  I remember during high school in the 1980s when
everyone who wanted to demonstrate their individual non-conformity sported a
Mohawk -- everyone.  This is the same.

Yes, it's true that scientific consensus is occasionally overthrown; sometimes
an Einstein or a Darwin comes along to shake things up.  But unless one actually
is Darwin or Einstein, claiming to see this shift ahead of time is supercilious
nonsense.
