At the last several Andover Town Meetings, there has been talk about a supposed
conflict of interest in having a Board of Finance member married to the First
Selectman.  This is utter nonsense and an insult to the integrity of Marie and
Bob Burbank.

If the Board of Finance was asked to vote on the compensation for the First
Selectman, Marie should clearly recuse herself from the decision.  But that's
not permitted by the charter, and it's hard to imagine another circumstance that
might cause a conflict of interest.

Anyone who would claim that there is a conflict because these spouses are
certain to agree on issues of importance has, first off, clearly never been
married and has, more importantly, entirely missed the point that good
government is about engendering agreement.  The whole structure of our town
government is about creating some sort of rough consensus.  If a member of our
Board of Finance shares some priorities with our First Selectman, let me be the
first to cheer them on.

These are elected positions.  The First Selectman did not appoint his wife to
office.  Nor did she sneak him through the door.  The voters of this town chose
them both.  If you don't like having them in their current positions, vote for
someone else next time.  Or better yet, run for office yourself; this town
desperately needs people willing to volunteer their time to help run its various
boards, commissions, and committees.  But don't insult the hard-working Bob and
Marie Burbank.
