Donald Trump is allergic to the truth.  He repeats his lies again and again,
shouting over any voices noting his errors.  We have entered an era of lies,
damned lies, and Republicans.

I suppose it's not a big surprise then that letters supporting Mr. Trump employ
the same tactic.  When Sam Prentice says (again!) that Mr. Trump's electoral win
was massive, please remember that he is referring to a win in the bottom 25%,
number 46 of our 58 presidential elections, involving by far the lowest popular
vote margin for any winning candidate in history, -2.8 million.

Then Mr. Prentice claims that the heads of the CIA and the FBI count for nothing
in their statements that the Russians attempted to influence the election in
favor of Donald Trump. But he floats his own entirely unsubstantiated theory
that Secretary Clinton's servers were hacked (the FBI says there is no evidence
of that) and that the NSA was responsible, doing so in retaliation for Clinton's
supposed security breaches.  Mr. Prentice's source for this outlandish theory?
Trump advisor Andrew Napolitano.  (Actually, Mr. Trump might want to be careful
of that particular advisor, who noted that the real meaning of the Second
Amendment, "is not that it protects the right to shoot deer. It protects the
right to shoot tyrants.")

Let's say that again.  Sam Prentice argues that the public statements of two of
our top intelligence officials, not to mention our current President, mean
nothing.  But the conspiracy theory from a television talking head with no
intelligence experience is more plausible,

Mr. Prentice, I hate to break it to you, but maybe with the following things
cleared up you can see our national situation more clearly: there are no
unicorns, the earth is round, and the Tooth Fairy is just your parents.
