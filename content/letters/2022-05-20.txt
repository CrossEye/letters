Michael Goodie and Ed Kozlowski make similar points.  Gun laws, they say, are
absurd because criminals, by definition, don't follow the law.  I wonder if they
understand that the same infantile tautology applies to *all* criminal law.  Do
they think we shouldn't have laws against rape and murder because only criminals
would rape and murder?  Should we have no laws regulating the handling of toxic
chemicals because only criminals would dump those in our waterways?

The argument in favor of gun control is a simple moral one.  The abundance of
guns in our society makes us much more vulnerable.  We should reduce the number
of guns and make people safer.

Of course the Constitution specifically protects the right to bear arms.  From
1791 to 2008 regulations limited this right in many ways.   In 2008, the Heller
decision claimed for the first time that this is an individual right and that
the "well-regulated militia" clause was merely prefatory, another in a series of
bad rulings by the Supreme Court.

One of the rationales for the right to bear arms is that citizens should be able
to protect themselves from a tyrannical government.  If this is an individual
right, then if my government has machine guns, I must be allowed to have them
too for protection.  If they have tanks, I must be able to keep one in my
garage.  If they have biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, they cannot
prevent me from stockpiling these myself.  If this sounds absurd to you,
congratulations, you're paying attention.

It's really quite simple: if we drastically reduce the number of guns in our
society, we also drastically reduce the number of harm doers who have access to
them.  If we do that, then we drastically reduce the threat they pose to all of
us.
