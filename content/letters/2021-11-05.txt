The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) is an explicitly right-wing
seniors' group. A letter from Bob DeMarchi cited a poll from AMAC
(http://link.sauyet.com/33) describing current issues. All he did was to quote
their options, changing a few words. Codswallop, balderdash, poppycock,
tommyrot. This was not even the *result* of the self-selected, non-scientific
poll; it was the list of ridiculously biased *questions* it asked.

Let's look at one issue raised. It mentions Critical Race Theory, calling it
indoctrination. It's an excellent bet that you had never heard of CRT two years
ago. It entered our consciousness when Fox News made it famous by talking
incessantly about it. The usual right-wing suspects followed along.

No, they're not teaching it to your fourth-graders. No, it's not taking over the
school system. No, it's not undermining our republic.

Critical Race Theory is a fifty-year old academic discussion seen mostly in
graduate school. It's the simple notion that racism is structural, not merely
individual. This is so obvious that only the most ideologically blinded
reactionaries could deny it. Have you heard of slavery? Of Jim Crow? Of
lynchings? Of red-lining? Of racial sentencing disparities? To deny CRT is to
deny these had to do with race.

Certain brain-dead state legislatures are reacting to Fox's propaganda,
restricting what may be taught, going as far as prohibiting lessons that might
make students "feel discomfort, guilt, or anguish" because of their race or sex.
Talk about cancel culture! Conservatives are trying to cancel knowledge, trying
to coddle the fragile children by denying them their history. The irony is
exquisite.

"We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism
are all tied together," said Martin Luther King. Those attempting to deny it are
simply demonstrating how right-wing ideology warps the minds of its adherents.
