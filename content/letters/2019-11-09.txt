Larry Zimmerman's list of predictions is meaningless without references; it was
probably created out of whole cloth by a denialist. But he makes another point
worth pursuing: the ozone hole is shrinking. He believes this is an argument
against scientific environmentalism. It's precisely the opposite.

Scientists recognized that CFCs were the primary contributors to the dangerous
and growing ozone hole. Policy-makers regulated the emissions of CFCs and last
year's ozone hole was the smallest on record.

This was not the only such instance.

Scientists recognized that sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides were the primary
contributors to the dangerous and growing presence of acid rain. Policy-makers
regulated the emissions of S02 and NOx and acid rain has fallen steadily since.

Scientists recognized that car emissions were the primary contributors to the
dangerous and growing smog in large cities. Policy-makers regulated car
emissions and it's been many years since the regular Los Angeles smog reports.

We've cleaned up the air, rivers, oceans, soil, and ground-water by listening to
the scientists and changing policy.

Scientists recognized that greenhouse gases such as CO2 are the primary
contributors to the dangerous warming of our planet... We're still waiting on
the policy-makers.

Regarding Dan Armstrong: I did my homework, reading the source material he
presented. I was not convinced that he'd uncovered much more than cranks. I do
read primary material. One great list of source documents is Wikipedia. Even if
we must take its own pages with a grain of salt, it's a great place for links to
primary material. But for now, I'm done. If Mr. Armstrong still doesn't
understand that making models of the natural world is central to science, we
have little left to discuss. He may want to read Karl Popper, though. Mr.
Armstrong, feel free to have the last word.
