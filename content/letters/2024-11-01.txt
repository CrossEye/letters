At the Andover Charter hearing, First Selectman Jeff Maguire said, "I actually
take the fact that Don Denley, a far right Republican, and Scott Sauyet, a far
left Democrat [...] believe that these issues are inaccurate... I feel that that
is a win because that means that we're driving the bus right down the middle of
the field."

Ignoring his odd desire to drive a bus through a field, that sounds sensible,
right?  Although a little cowardly, there's often a desire to find middle-ground
between two extremes.  What's wrong with that?

It's simple: there is no middle ground.  Don and I are saying the *exact same
thing*!

While we forcefully disagree on many issues, we completely agree that
questions 6 – 11 substantially rearrange Andover's power structures, taking
authority away from you and me and handing it to the BOS and Town Administrator.
With all due respect to the revision commission's hard work, the process was too
rushed and the results show it.

Several misleading ballot questions *sound* reasonable but misrepresent the
associated text changes.  It makes sense to move seven days, aligning the town
budget vote with the RHAM one; why does this mean other processes move *thirty*
days?  Why does it mean the Town Administrator gets first crack at all budgets,
including AES?  Why does it mean the Board of Finance's authority gets watered
down, adding the BOS to their hearing?  What language would the charter include
if Question 10 passes but 7 and 8 do not?  Why would we want to strip voters'
right to choose a Town Clerk and decide on proposed ordinances?

When we're told this is for "efficiency", just remember that the most efficient
government is a dictatorship.

There is no middle ground.  Please vote no on Questions 6 – 11.  (More info:

While this was sent in time for the usual deadline, I hadn't noticed that the
deadline had changed for this week.  The editor also said it violated the 
no-negative election letters in the last issue before the election.  I disagree
about that, but the point is moot due to the missed deadline.
