What sort of characteristics do we want in our Board of Education candidates?

Mostly, I think, we want them to be qualified, competent, and compassionate.
They need to put kids first.  They need to avoid squabbling and focus on real
problems and real solutions.

Andover has three great candidates for that.

The first two are well-known to residents who've been paying any attention to
local matters.  Gerry Cremé has served well on the BOE for many years, including
time as its Chair.  His have been steady hands on the reins, with a clear love
for the children that served him well in his career as a teacher and now serves
Andover's schoolchildren. Mike Beckwith is still working as a teacher, after an
earlier career in finance. He brings to the Board the zeal of a parent of
Andover children and a real understanding of the complexities of school finance.

Sharon St. Rock is running for the first time.  With years of nursing background
and a decade as a school nurse, she brings a different perspective but the same
focus on the needs of children.  She is a problem solver, and a wonderful
listener.  She is so well qualified that after the Democrats endorsed her, the
Republicans followed suit.  As one who's been extremely upset by the situation
caused by national Republicans, I may even vote for her on the Republican line,
just to show I still can.

Highly qualified, extremely competent, and unwaveringly compassionate: that's
all three of these candidates.  With a focus on kids, and backgrounds in
education, finance, and health care, they are a formidable group.

Please vote for Michael Beckwith, Gerry Cremé, and Sharon St. Rock for Andover's
Board of Education!
