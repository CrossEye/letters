What is wrong with this country?  I looked at online news today.  The top three
U.S. stories had these headlines:

  - *"A Sacramento mass shooting victim has been identified as police hunt for the
suspects who killed 6 people"*

  - *"2 dead, 2 injured in daytime shooting near San Francisco playground"*

  - *"Dallas concert shooting leaves 1 dead, 11 wounded"*

But the usual idiots will surely be back tomorrow telling us that gun control is
immoral, stupid, and unconstitutional.

No.

What's actually immoral is permitting this ongoing slaughter.

What's actually stupid is failing to act on one of the most easily preventable
causes of death in the land.

What's actually unconstitutional is preventing states from performing their
traditional duty in defining what a "well-regulated militia" entails.
