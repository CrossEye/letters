Aravis Pasha has missed the point. The point is simple: silence equals
complicity. Local Republican officials are taking no stand against their
national party dismantling our social safety netâ€”to significant damaging local
effect. Others are speaking out. Local Republicans are not. The call is for
these Republican officials to find some courage and develop some integrity or
risk getting voted out.

The letter Ms. Pasha was responding to ("Protect Our Safety Nets", Cris
Lawrence, 7/11/25) was not fear-mongering. It specifically disavowed extreme
partisan loyalty. Its call to action was simple: This moment demands leadership
that puts people first.

In trying to discuss Medicaid, Ms. Pasha cites two articles. One is a 10-year
old opinion piece. The other is not about Medicaid at all, but about Medicare.
It's the harmful cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that Ms. Lawrence was discussing.
However her Medicare numbers were also out-of-date.

Aravis Pasha doesn't mention that there will be 16 million more uninsured under
recent Republican policy changes, or that nationally we can expect over 42,000
additional deaths because of them.

These are moral questions. What type of society do we want to be? How do we
protect the vulnerable? Who do we put first, the people or the obscenely rich?
The answers from all levels of the Republican party are disheartening.

We would like to offer our strongest support to Cris Lawrence and the Hebron
Democratic Town Committee in their attempt to ensure that empathy remains a core
civic value.
