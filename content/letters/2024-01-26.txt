Ed Kozlowski is a funny guy.  We could discuss Ken Hjulstrom's fantasy or
Michael Chotkowski's wretchedly confused nonsense, but I'll focus on Mr.
Kowlowski's screed.  After all, it's refreshing that he presents actual content
instead of his usual vacuity.  That content is false, but still it's an
improvement.

First, he won't scare me by claiming to be good at mathematics.  I have two
math degrees. 

Second, we need to explain something to those who don't understand math... or
economics... or government... or much else:  A president's first budget takes
effect October 1<sup>st</sup>.  Earlier economic effects are the result of their
predecessor or of factors outside Presidential control.  Perhaps the fairest
comparison is between the 27 months starting with those Octobers.  Including
the mishandled pandemic period would be infinitely worse for Trump. 

Mr. Kozlowski focuses on inflation.  It's risen faster under Biden (by 4.7%
annually) than in recent years, but is below the increase in wages (up 5.1% per
year).  Most people are better off.  However yes: food's gone up faster (6.9%)
than wages.  Job creation, though, was twice as fast for Biden than for Trump.

It's amusing that he'd blame Biden for lumber prices, which are due to booming
home improvements during the Covid lockdown and to Trump's' tariffs on Canadian
lumber.  But it's hilarious because since the start of Biden's first budget,
lumber prices have *fallen* 8.6% annually, where they rose to crazy heights
during Trump's budgets, doubling before settling down.

He claims spiraling debt; funny, it rose 8.3% per year under Biden, 8.9% per
year under Trump.  He blames Biden for the invasion of Ukraine, when everyone
knows that Trump's puppet-master, Putin, was responsible.  He mentions a Biden
gaffe; the continuing stream of gaffes from Trump is infinitely worse.

Yeah, a funny guy all right.

small screen like a phone.  Sorry.

You can also fiddle with other date ranges, or add your own calculations of 
the change of values over some months by entering your own rows at the table
at the top.
