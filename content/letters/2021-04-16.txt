The right wing is at it again.  "War is peace.  Freedom is slavery.  Ignorance
is strength."  They want you disbelieve the evidence in front of you because
they find the truth inconvenient.

Sam Prentice suggests the January 6 attacks on the Capitol were a minor protest
and that last year's Black Lives Matter protests were a violent uprising.  He
critiques Joe Stevens for the words "insurrection" and "attempted coup".  The
definition of "insurrection" is an obvious fit.  "Coup" is less so, but the
analogy was clear.  Mr. Prentice prefers "incursion", which imputes some
military legitimacy for this act of sedition.

Next, he belabors the death of one seditionist at the hands of the police, while
belittling the protesters incensed by police brutality and police killings of
black men.  Last summer's George Floyd protests were far and away peaceful
affairs; much of the actual violence involved counter-protester actions and
unprovoked attacks by police. (http://link.sauyet.com/18)

Bill Olliver and Gary Gile want us to believe that Georgia's new election laws
-- and presumably all the others Republican legislatures are trying to pass --
are meant only to improve voting, that the negative feedback is political
nonsense.

If Georgia's election laws needed an overhaul, why didn't they need it in 2016
when Republicans won Georgia' presidential and Senate races, or in 2018, when
Republican Kemp's shady voter roll purging led to his winning the governorship?
No, they suddenly needed it immediately after Democrats won the presidential and
both Senate races during record turnout.  They choose to strip power from their
Secretary of State only after he refuses to take part in Trump's attempted
steal.  The new law is obviously designed to reduce voter participation, to
benefit Republicans.

"But look over here," they'll tell you.  "We've got something shiny to distract
you from the truth."
