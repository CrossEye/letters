It's hard to tell what -- if anything -- runs through the minds of certain
letter-writers.  Their information-to-words ratio is astoundingly low.  Case in
point: Don Denley's latest.

He challenges Edmund Smith's discussion of Timothy McVeigh, because America's
most famous terrorist was White.  The statistics are easy to find: mass
shooters' races roughly mirror those of the population at large
(http://link.sauyet.com/51); the race of the perpetrators should not be an
issue.  Let's look at his example.  We know intuitively that if the accused was
White, had shot in self-defense using a licensed gun, and turned himself in to
the police, then Mr. Denley would be outraged that he was subject to house
arrest and a $25,000 bail when the only charge was not having a concealed carry
permit.  Instead, he makes it an issue of race, and disparages a judge for doing
her job, simply because of her race.

Then, in a stunning instance of projection, he accuses me of fascism.  I'm
closer to socialism.  Fascism is its opposite, and the province of the Trumpian
fan-base, where this sort of projection has become constant.  He claims his
economic theory is fact and that the Biden administration must be lying about
all the good economic numbers.  He does this without evidence... because there
is none.  (Why didn't he think the numbers were fudged during the Trump years?)

He also claims that I talk weekly about the Biden economy.  This one is easy to
check.  My letters to the editor are online  (http://letters.sauyet.com).  I
double-checked: one full letter discussed oil prices, and one sentence of
another rebuts Mr. Denley's nonsense on the economy.  That's it.

So what was he thinking about any of this?  It's really hard to know.  But one
thing is clear: his mouth runneth over.
