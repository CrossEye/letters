Andover is blessed with a number of excellent candidates for the local Board of
Education, but I'd like to single out one in particular. Christina Tamburro grew
up in town and attended Andover Elementary School.  A former teacher, with
additional professional work in finance, Christina is now a stay-at-home mom.

Our Board of Education deals with a great variety of concerns; beyond the
obvious curriculum and management, there are issues of recruitment,
transportation, maintenance, insurance, financing, technology, policy,
professional development, and many others.  The Board most definitely needs
people with a variety of skills.  Christina's understanding of education,
business, and family, and particularly her skills in analyzing legal and
financial documents make her an outstanding candidate; the Board would be lucky
to have her.

Christina and her family have a long history of giving back to the community.
Her mother has been especially involved, having served the town in numerous
positions, including First Selectman.  It's Christina's turn now.  She is
offering to give back to Andover by adding her skills to the Board of Education.
I hope you will support her in this and vote for Christina Tamburro May 4
