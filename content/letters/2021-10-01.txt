Gary Gile rejects being conspiracy-minded. As he suggests, let's think for
ourselves. Some quotes:

"[Joe Biden] wants to punish half the population because they did not vote for
him." (1/29)

"[S]ome forces in the world are using [Covid-19 and climate change] to bring
about 'The Great Reset'." (2/5)

"Governments around the world have used [Covid-19] to control their populations
and are succeeding better than any war could have succeeded." (2/5)

"From what I've read, we're actually headed into a mini-ice age." (2/12)

There's a "movement spearheaded by Bill Gates, George Soros, and Klaus Schwab,
whose main focus is to establish a one-world government in their desired image."
(2/12)

"[Congress strips] us of our right to free speech or ignores it when others deny
us the freedom to share our opinion." (3/12)

"Courts lock up people for seven years because they refused to give the source
code to their software." (3/12)

"Nine percent of [the Covid stimulus] went to COVID-19 'relief.' The rest went
to fill the pockets of special interest groups, foreign governments, and
repaying those who helped get democrats elected." (3/19)

"This 'cancel culture' craziness has gone way too far. Businesses like Dove soap
no longer using the word 'normal' in their advertising." (4/2)

"[W]hat you read in mainstream news media is exactly what serves the purposes of
an elite class that controls 'what we read, watch, or listen to.'" (9/3)

"Americans are afraid of dying from [Covid] which is no more deadly than the
yearly flu." (9/10)

"[T]he current administration has mastered the power of fear with the help of
Gates, Soros, and Schwab." (9/17)

"[S]tudies show that masks may be detrimental to your health by trapping CO2 and
germs." (9/24)

Notice the gap without any conspiracy theories? You guessed it. That's when he
wasn't writing.

You decide!
