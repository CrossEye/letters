I believe no single person can be wrong about everything.  Sam Prentice aspires
to disprove this.  His arguments about reparations are absurd, misinformed, and
insulting.  To debate a subject, we should actually understand what it's about.

"They want white Americans to engage in self-flagellation for events occurring
over a century ago..."  No, reparation proponents are not asking "white
Americans" for anything.  They are looking for apologies and recompense from
institutions, not individuals.  If Mr. Prentice engages in self-flagellation,
it's for personal reasons.

Reparations involve two things: apologizing for past behavior and atoning for
harm.

Reparations have been made in America for slavery, for stealing land from Native
Americans, for internment of Japanese Americans, for police brutality and
torture, for illegal medical experiments and forced sterilizations.  Churches,
states, banks, colleges, and others have provided reparations for enabling
slavery.  Germany, Japan, Austria, and France have made reparations for WWII
atrocities.  (UMass maintains a wonderful reparations list:

Most American reparations go to racial minorities.  This makes sense.  There
remains intractable racial discrimination in housing, the criminal justice
system, and college admissions.  Systemic racial biases demonstrate the enormous
shadow of slavery, our country's original sin.  Reparations are one small
partial fix for the problem.   They're unlikely in the current political
climate, but so was the recent national apology for slavery.

Mr. Prentice's focus on the Democratic party's history is tedious.  Yes, it
should apologize for connections to slavery; I don't know if it ever has.
Ignore his lies about Chicago; I doubt even he believes them.  But we should
note the absurdity of his claiming Democrats interned the Japanese.  It was the
U.S. government; the President's party is irrelevant.

As usual, Mr. Prentice ignores facts and makes absurd conclusions.  Perhaps he's
the exception that proves my rule.
