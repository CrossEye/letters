Our latest leadership crisis demonstrates a basic flaw in libertarian thinking.
American libertarianism, which has captured the GOP, is the sort that emphasizes
property rights over all others, holding that a livable society occurs solely
through individuals competitively pursuing their own ends; that therefore most
exercises of government power are illegitimate. Its most radical strand suggests
that the only proper government institutions are the military, the police, and
the courts, the latter mostly to protect property and contract law.

In such a society, I ask, who can we trust to rule? How do we find generals,
judges, lawmakers, and administrators? If every individual should pursue selfish
ends, how can we grant anyone authority? How do we avoid corruption?

We are caught by that now, of course. Our so-called president uses the weight of
his office for personal gain. Withholding military aid to Ukraine, pressuring
them into investigating a political rival -- then misusing the national
intelligence infrastructure to cover it up -- is just one in a long line of
self-dealing scandals.

This is new. I thought George W. Bush was manipulated by those around him for
their own interests, but I never suspected he considered the presidency his cash
cow. That is true for all presidents I remember, back at least to Ford. Even
when I vehemently disagreed with them, I believed they were motivated by what
they thought best for the country. Until now. Until Donald Trump.

Libertarians should remember: this is a natural result of their philosophy.
