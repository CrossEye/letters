Perhaps I owe Sam Prentice an apology.  When he wrote, "These hypocrites ignored
the siege on the White House... [but] decry Jan. 6th as an insurrection," I
thought he was trying to draw parallels between them.  Maybe not.  He was also
spouting ridiculous nonsense about BLM and bail and the Vice President; perhaps
I got lost in his argument.  If so, I'm sorry.  But if he did mean to suggest an
equivalence, he still deserves our scorn.

I do owe a separate apology.  Unlike Mr. Prentice, I supply references to back
up my claims.  Links in a recent letter were broken, one about the doctored
video of Rosanne Boyland's death, another debunking lies about Kamala Harris and
bail.  I'm sorry.  I've corrected both online at
http://letters.sauyet.com/#/2022-02-25/.

I have no reason to apologize over critiquing Mr. Prentice for describing Jan.
6th as "little more than a disruption at Golden Corral."  That is simply a
stupid and dangerous lie.

In a classic misdirection, he deflects on due processes denied for Jan. 6th
participants.  I asked for sources; he just suggests I'd been living under a
rock and was the prisoner of partisan media.  Ignoring his sophomoric
projection, I'll note that I did research before posting this.  I've done more
today.  I found plenty of stories from last spring with many allegations and
fact-checking refutations.  Most recent stories were from sources with no
credibility (IndependentSentinel.com, TownHall.com, Breitbart.com) or even the
tinfoil hat brigade (NeedToKnow.news.)  A few months ago, there were only about
40 incarcerated protesters still awaiting trial.

Sam Prentice claimed a lack of due process.  Goldberg vs. Kelley spelled out
what due processes are required in criminal cases.  Can Mr. Prentice demonstrate
(with references, please) specific defendants denied any of these legal rights?
Or is he just moaning?
