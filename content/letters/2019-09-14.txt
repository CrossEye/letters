(Part 3 of a short series on scientists opposing the global warming consensus.
Last week: the Turku and Svenmark papers, Giaever, Evans, and Woodcock.)

Dan Armstrong quotes additional scientists Robert Laughlin, Judith Curry, John
T. Reid, and Petr Chýlek.

Robert Laughlin says the earth doesn't care and will outlast any problems we
create.  Dr. Laughlin is another scientist weighing in where he has no
expertise, but the main point of his most famous article
(http://bit.ly/earth-knows) is that the earth has suffered great catastrophes
before and survived.  I'm afraid I root for humanity and don't have his
dispassionate approach.  While he disputes the strength of the consensus
opinion, he does accept it.

Judith Curry, by contrast, has impeccable climatology credentials and a position
of leadership in the field.  If she were raising questions about the reality of
anthropogenic global warming (AGW), it would be interesting news.  Instead, her
most quoted article (http://bit.ly/curry-on-credibility) simply objects to the
science community's political handling of climate controversy, an important
point certainly, but not relevant to the reality of AGW.

For John T Reid, I find skeptical blog posts and industry articles but no
academic qualifications or peer-reviewed articles.  Are there reliable
references?

I couldn't find the Petr Chýlek article quoted ("Hiatus: Existence, Causes, and
Future Temperature Projections".)  But I read some of his work, and it's within
the consensus formulation, questioning only the degree of AGW.  He explains "The
Hiatus", a decade where surface air temperature stopped growing.  This is
important, given how skeptics emphasize this pause: only a bit more than 2% of
the total heat in the system is in the atmosphere.  Over 93% is in the oceans.
When atmospheric heat stopped rising, ocean heat didn't pause and global
temperatures continued their rapid rise.
