Donald Trump, the poor dear, is being bullied. Donna Jean Burke explained to us
last week how the only unbiased news source, Fox News, has opened her eyes to
the terrible burden placed upon the unfortunate billionaire candidate.

She's right, of course. Not content with with providing Mr. Trump with hundreds
of millions of dollars in free exposure, the mainstream media is also reporting
his racist, xenophobic, misogynistic diatribes as though they were the words of
a normal statesman. But all that is buried by the terrible disservice the media
is doing to Trump: believe it or not, they have the gall to accurately report
what he says. The bullies!
