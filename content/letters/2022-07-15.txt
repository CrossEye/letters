Last week we received several lectures.  It's good to learn new things, but only
if the lecturer has the facts.

James Mathias lectured us on fetal development, explaining what anyone who ever
took a Health class should already know.  Then he editorialized.  He tells us
that after the egg is fertilized, "Any termination of that process along life's
continuum ends a human life."  He fails to mention that fully two thirds of
fertilized eggs do not make it as far as birth.  If he wants to take that up
with someone, pro-choicers are a much smaller issue than Mother Nature or
whatever god(s) he worships.

There is a consistent pro-life position, but it's exceedingly rare.  It implies
that you can be forced to donate blood -- or a kidney -- because someone else
might need it, that an adult can be forbidden from having a drink, because it
might interfere with someone else's development.  If we reject that, then under
what theory should a thirteen year old be forced to carry her rapist's child to
term? 

Don Denley lectured us on gun rights.  He tells us that the 2nd Amendment is an
absolute right.  Does that mean anyone may own any armament, regardless of age,
criminal record, mental illness, history of violence?  Can I keep a tank in my
garage?  How about anthrax?  Absurd, yes, but then this a gun advocate.

Also, he suggests I am a strong Biden supporter.  No, Biden was not in my top
ten in the Democratic debates.  He's infinitely better than his predecessor, but
I think Biden is the worst president of my 56 years, save only a few: Nixon,
Carter, Reagan, both Bushes, and, of course, Trump, our worst president ever.

In any case, lectures are fine.  But first, please check your facts.
