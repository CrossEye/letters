Some recent news:

Tuesday:

  * Donald John Trump falls asleep in court while a porn star testifies about an
  affair with him and about the coverup.
  * Joseph Robinette Biden gives a well-received speech about the most thorny
  foreign policy issue currently plaguing us.

Wednesday:
  * JRB announces the groundbreaking of a major new plant he helped negotiate on
  the grounds of the failed DJT Foxconn initiative.  (Remember the golden
  shovels?)

Thursday:
  * DJT grovels for campaign contributions from the oil industry, promising to
  roll back successful environmental initiatives. 
  * JRB makes a hard decision on that thorny, party-dividing policy issue.

Sunday:
  * DJT praises Hannibal Lecter (a fictional cannibalistic serial killer) in a
  typical, rambling speech.

Monday:
  * DJT simply scowls as he listens to his former lawyer implicate him in
  illegal activity.

Anyone who thinks that Trump would be better than Biden has a short memory and
has not been following the news.  Anyone claiming little difference between the
Republicans and the Democrats is clearly not paying attention; there is no
UniParty.  The recent Time Interview with Trump is mandatory reading for those
who want to consider themselves informed: https://time.com/6972022/.
