Third in a series discussing what progressives actually believe. Last time: how
government helps level the playing field between rich and poor children.

A competing philosophy proclaims that a smaller government is always a better
government. Those preaching this don't really believe it. The proof: ask if they
would support eliminating our military, jails, and police in order to reduce the
size of the government. If not, they don't truly believe smaller is always
better. Then one can actually discuss competing priorities for what government
should do. If they argue that the military, the courts, and the police are the
central functions of government, ask how they respond to someone who sees
education and environmental protections as central. Why are their issues more
important? Just because they say so?

Progressives recognize that government can and does overstep its mandate. It
enforces biases of the majority on everyone, even in places where it has no
business, such as the Jim Crow laws or statutes forbidding gay marriage.
Thankfully, the force of history is generally with liberalism; over time society
grows more tolerant, more liberal, more accepting of differences. Government
eventually follows.

Sometimes the government does the wrong thing, and it becomes our duty to change
it. This has happened often: the Dred Scott decision, Japanese internment camps,
McCarthy witch-hunts, anti-miscegenation laws, the recently fallen laws against
gay marriage.

We must be ever-vigilant. A current issue is the NSA's domestic spying. To
liberals, this is intolerable. Our government has claimed rights far beyond what
society is willing to grant. This must stop. We are glad to have conservative
and libertarian allies in this battle, but are suspicious of their motivation.
Supporters of the USA PATRIOT now upset by the powers the government claims are
hypocritical.

Next time: The power of corporations.
