During the past five years, Andover has suffered through some terrible financial
times, starting with the debacle of the Barnett administration and continuing
through the ongoing fallout of the Bush recession. I don't envy Bob Burbank the
job he's had to face as First Selectman. Just keeping the lights on in these
conditions is a major accomplishment. Bob Burbank has done a credible job. So
I'm somewhat sorry not to be endorsing Bob for another term. But it's time for
something more than just credible; it's time to put Andover back on the right
track.

So it's with great pleasure that I recommend Julia Haverl. Her years of deep
involvement in our community speak for themselves. It's hard to think of anyone
who's done more for the town.

But it's her ability to bring together disparate groups that will be her
strongest asset. Andover has so many serious problems right now, and the fact
that different interest groups are fighting for pieces of a shrinking fiscal pie
has made our civic discourse far too discordant.

We need a First Selectman who can comfortably work with everyone, bringing
together all of the community into constructive dialog. We need someone who can
discover creative solutions to our budget problems. We need someone who can help
us restore the basic services that have been whittled away for years. We need
someone who can steer us back in the direction this great town should be
heading.

We need Julia.

Please vote for her Monday, May 2.
