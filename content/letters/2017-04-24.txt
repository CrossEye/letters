Ten years ago, Al Gore presented his devastating critique of the Bush
Administration.  He convincingly argued that American democracy, founded on
principles of reasoned discourse, was under attack from people who employed
opinions in place of facts and ideology in place of reason.

The Trump administration carries this much further, waging a war on truth
itself.  From inauguration crowds to "alternative facts" to "the Mexicans will
pay for it" to "Obama spied" to an uncountable number of lies, large and small,
our so-called president and his cronies have debased the idea of facts
themselves.

Please call it out when you see a naked emperor.  Ignoring it empowers the liars
to lie even more.
