Georgette Conrad and I have had some disagreements in these pages.  I want to
make it clear that I have a great deal of respect for her.  With her serious
involvement, she is one of the people who help keep the town running.  I don’t
want to turn this into “He said, she said,” so I won’t respond on these matters
after this.  If she wants the last word, it’s hers.  But first...

I think I am doing the same thing she accuses Steve Reade of doing, trying to
get out as many votes as possible in support of the budget.  I have an email
list of nearly two hundred residents who I urge to attend meetings and vote in
referendums.  I don’t usually suggest how they should vote, but my list is
composed of people I expect will likely share my own views.  While I agree that
the newcomer’s calling people at the meeting “ignorant” was shabby, I still
applaud his presence at to our meeting.  As I said before, democracy is best
served by widespread participation.  I didn’t think her letter was specifically
about me, but I do think her notion of “stacking the meeting” is simply in
error.

As to a supposed conflict of interest, I’d like to point to a higher authority
than the editor of a local newspaper: the town voters.  It was well-known that
his wife was serving on the Board of Finance when the town elected Bob Burbank
First Selectmen.  In fact no one even ran against him.  We elected these people,
whether or not Georgette Conrad or the editor of the Chronicle agrees with our
choices.  There is a reasonable gripe about the short notification of meetings;
that’s something that really should be addressed.  But that’s no reason to
besmirch the people who are putting in a great deal of time trying to keep this
town operating.  I simply see no conflict of interest between having a Board of
Finance member married to the First Selectman.
