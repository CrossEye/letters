Not to detract from Annie Steinbrecher's debt ceiling point, but the quote
about 25% of our debt coming during Trump's budgets needs context.  As Obama's
budgets ended, 42% of all debt had been incurred during his two terms; for Bush
Jr., it was 50% in two; for Clinton, 24% in two; for Bush Sr., 35% in one; for
Reagan, 65% in two; for Carter, 30% in one.  Clinton was the only one far better
than Trump; Bush Sr. and Reagan were far worse.

Regarding our nonconformist, Sam Prentice says he always, "performs my own due
diligence on the information I seek and receive."  This from someone who lamely
attempts to rebut established climate science by invoking charlatan Tony Heller?
This from someone who -- recycling stories from Fox News, The Daily Caller, and
The New York Post -- claims his independent Clinton Foundation research reaches
the exact conclusion they did, and clings to it even as it's demolished by
experts.

Think of the folderol about Critical Race Theory.  In 2020, the entire "do your
own research" posse simultaneously did their own research about a discipline
unchallenged since its 1975 introduction, and amazingly reached identical
conclusions... unrelated of course to Fox's incessant hype.  Totally
coincidental independent investigations by these nonconformists made them all
write anti-CRT letters to the *Rivereast*.

Choosing lesser-known and less-respected sources of information is not
independent research.  Acting just like everyone else in the smaller crowd is
not nonconformity.

Note, *Scientific American* does not practice science but explains and
popularizes science.  Just like *National Geographic* describing but not
practicing anthropology, or *People* reporting on performers but not performing
itself. Also, I'm curious: If "Leftist Democrats are the most destructive and
devastating forces in the world," where do Leftist Independents, Centrist
Democrats and MAGA Republicans fall on the scale? 6, 2023

P.S. Not for publication, but for fact-checking the budget numbers: 
[US Debt by President][db]

An example, "President H.W. Bush added $1.55 trillion to the debt, a 54%
increase from the $2.857 trillion debt at the end of Reagan's last budget."  So
54 / (100 + 54) = .350649..., or 35% was incurred during his budgets.


For the Clinton Foundation, I've quoted the relevant research in [previous letters][cf].


For CRT, a [New Yor Times Article][cr] is a good overview, and of course the 
[Wikipedia Page][wp]

For Global warming, just read practically any scientific survey.
