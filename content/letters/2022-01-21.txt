Longtime Rivereast letter readers will recognize the spirit of Robert Kodym's
fascinating prose surviving in the form of a recent letter from Pat Schmidt.  I
would love to write a rebuttal here, but it's entirely unclear what the writer
is talking about.

Except here: one phrase is very clear, and very frightening. "There is no
definitive truth to anything these days."

That someone would say this scares the pants off me.  That people actually
believe it should terrify us all.  It means that the Bush, Jr. administration's
assault on reason has succeeded and Trump's further attack on truth itself is
taking hold.

This is the stuff of despots.  It's the "Only I can fix it" mentality carried to
its logical end.  It leads to, "I don't have to listen to your evidence; I know
I'm right."  It's what lets the letter-writer put scare-quotes around
"statistics", because, of course, all facts must be flexible.  Once again,
Orwell's quote seems prescient: "[The totalitarians] told you to reject the
evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command."

I can't tell if the letter's headline, "The Truth Will Prevail" represents the
writer's own irony or is a copy-editor's version of whistling past the
graveyard.

In fact, there is truth, and there are real techniques for finding it.  But all
of them require a first step that seems to be beyond certain people.  First, you
need to open your mind.
