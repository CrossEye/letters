I owe Georgette Conrad an apology.

My previous letter went too far, painting the label of selfishness on all
conservatives. My first draft included "especially the libertarian variety",
later cut when editing for length. That was unfortunate. There are plenty of
generous, kindhearted conservatives. I know Ms. Conrad, and know her to be one
of them. I'm very sorry.

I meant to say not that the large majority of conservatives are fighting the
social distancing rules, but that the large majority of those fighting the
social distancing rules are conservatives. There is plenty of data on this, most
recently this week's Pew Research article: https://pewrsr.ch/2Mxm83D. This is
based on party affiliation, not political viewpoint, but the correlation is
clear. (The best study is also from Pew: https://pewrsr.ch/2UxYt7F.)

I recognize that not all conservatives feel this way; it's mostly those
promoting the virtue of selfishness: the Randians and the libertarian right.
Those who believe that government should only maintain a military, police force,
and court system tend toward suspicion of government efforts in public health
(or education, environmental protection, etc.) This strand of conservatism
objects to masks and social distancing rules.

But clearly this does not include all conservatives. I will try to be more
careful about such sweeping generalizations. I am battling ideas, not
individuals, and I absolutely got this wrong. Again, I apologize to Ms. Conrad
and to all other goodhearted conservatives I insulted.
