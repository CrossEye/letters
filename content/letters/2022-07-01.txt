Truth can be hard to distinguish amidst the noise of falsehoods.  But sometimes
it's simple: last week's screed from our resident climate-change denier, for
example. ("Ongoing Climate Lie", June 24.)  Sam Prentice objects to my rebuttal
of recent letters.  His response is full of obfuscations and outright lies.

He claims I addressed nothing he said.  Let's see.  He wrote (see "The Party of
Death", May 27) that "[environmentalists] want to reduce the very substance
making things green, CO2".  In "Prentice Logic"
(http://letters.sauyet.com/#/2022-06-17/) I spent a paragraph parodying that,
then pointed out that the independent media-review site finds the blog he
mentioned (see "Fraudulent Climate Crisis", June 10) a "Quackery" pseudoscience
site (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/).  Finally, I
challenged the premise of his "Party of Death", suggesting this epithet is aimed
the wrong direction.  Does that sound like I addressed nothing he said?

I admit to an ambiguous pronoun when I wrote that he, "suggests we read the blog
of science denier Tony Heller [...] to learn about his imagined conspiracy..."
Here "his" was not aimed at the blogger but the letter-writer.  He's provided
plenty of evidence that he thinks the climate consensus is a conspiracy:
including his recent, "politician seek to destroy our self-sufficient middle
class and make everyone dependent on government for their sustenance."
Demonstrating the conspiracy-mindedness is certainly not *ad hominem*.

His most interesting suggestion is that I mislead by describing
http://realclimate.ORG as highly rated.  I cited a real reference
(https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/realclimate/).  That he finds the truth
inconvenient is irrelevant.

Presumably, he's aiming for irony in calling me a "genius", a "stalwart", and a
"luminary", but I'd like to temporarily claim that last one.  A luminary shines
light onto the darkness, revealing truth.  Mr. Prentice's letters need all the
light they can get.
