I met Kim Hawes when our children attended Andover Elementary together.  It was
a while before I realized that this quiet woman was a backbones of our
community.  Kim helps out wherever she can.  If your child played basketball,
you know Kim.  If you've interacted with the Community Emergency Response Team,
you know Kim.  If you've gotten involved with the Commission on Aging, you know
Kim.  If you've needed a Justice of the Peace, you may have met Kim.  And of
course, if you've had dealings with the Fire Department, you know Kim.

As an EMT with the Andover Volunteer Fire Department, Kim has observed the
commitment and dedication of our volunteers. She would like to ensure our
firefighters and EMT's have the resources and training necessary to continue to
protect and serve our community.

I met Mark Williams years ago, when he helped me out of a jam, and then another,
and another.  I know him for a compassionate man, and an extremely competent
one.  I have two fantastic memories of Mark.  One has him standing by himself,
hat off, over the grave of a recently-buried animal.  He stood quietly, praying
for the pet of a family he didn't even know.

The other memory involved a local woman having a breakdown and causing a ruckus
bad enough to require police involvement. As a friend of the family, I was
trying to help, but we weren't able to get through.  Mark was there as part of
the emergency response team.  He was the one able to respectfully calm her down
and get her to agree to the necessary ambulance ride.

Kim's commitment.  Mark's compassion.  The competence of both of them.  These
qualities will make them excellent Fire Commissioners.  Please vote for Kim
Hawes and Mark Williams for Andover's Fire Commission.
