Sarah Shapiro and Marcie Miner are right. It’s time for me to take a break. I’m
sure I’ll be back after a while, but it’s time for someone else to take up the
torch. Joe Stevens is going to need some backup!


I’ve been writing here mostly to counter lies that are written over and over by
a few others. I hate to see the lies stand, but as ridiculous as these letters
are, it’s hard to imagine that anyone believes them, even their writers. So I
will take a hiatus for a while. Please keep in mind when reading letters that
make extraordinary claims that these require extraordinary evidence. There are a
number of writers to this paper that don’t seem to know what evidence is.


So pay attention to what these folks say. If, like Victor Carli, all they can do
is misquote others, attempt to repudiate things no one has said, and promote
views no one who follows the news will believe, then they’re mostly harmless.
If, however, like Sam Prentice, they are actively attacking science, especially
that part which is trying to forestall the coming environmental disaster, then
they are dangerous. Those lies need to be challenged. I leave this in your
hands.
