Victor Carli needs to learn to read properly. I did not blame our so-called
president for global warming. Instead, I blamed him for abandoning the best
attempt to address it and forsaking America's leadership on the issue.

Mr. Carli describes the thermal relationship between Earth and Sun and
historical variations of temperature. Outside mistaking glaciers for galaxies
<del>and confusing an isotope of carbon with a temperature (huh?)</del>
(**Note**: *that last phrase was removed in the published version -- the editor
explained that it involved his own misreading of Mr. Carli's hand-written
letter*), his facts seem solid. But they're entirely irrelevant. The warming
scientists describe relates to a reduction of the energy reflected to space, not
the heat from burning carbon. The portion returned to space has been decreasing
because our atmosphere absorbs more energy.

The strong scientific consensus is that this is caused by human-generated gasses
in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. Mr. Carli presents no disputes to
this and he brings up irrelevancies. He discusses mathematical proof. Absurd:
science is never about that. And he mentions a temperature drop from January,
2014 to February, 2014 as though that were evidence against global warming. It's
easy to see how tiny an anomaly this is at http://bit.ly/seasonal-temps.

In short, humans are causing our land, oceans, and atmosphere to heat rapidly.
There is no scientific controversy over this. Yet fossil-fuel industry funded
researchers muddy the waters. Conservatives, threatened by changes to their
business models, buy into such crackpot theories.

Previously, when we've had ecological problems, people came together to address
them.  Note that litter has decreased in this generation. Note that toxic
waterways have been cleaned.  Note that we hear little now about acid rain or
the ozone hole.  We came together to solve such problems.  But these days, with
personalized news feeds creating echo chambers, we get people accepting
ridiculous lies and denying the truth.

Cloaking oneself in irrelevancies is still a form of lying.
