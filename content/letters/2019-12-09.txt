Imagine you are trying to argue against the prevailing view on a major
scientific topic. Its proponents' complain about skeptics accepting funding from
monied interests with a large stake in the prevailing view being wrong. Your
counter is that the government -- which heavily funds scientific research into
threats such as AIDS, the ozone hole, cancer, etc. -- has the temerity to fund
research on this topic, widely viewed as a much greater threat than all those
put together. To back this up, you quote a 10-year old paper published not by a
peer-reviewed journal, nor by a scientific committee, but by a pseudo-scientific
institute funded by those very monied interests.

I ask you, then: do you expect anyone to take you seriously?
