There's something unnerving about rejecting evidence because it doesn't match
preconceived theory.  It's even scarier when the one doing so proclaims others
to be scientifically illiterate.

I presented two comprehensive academic examinations of minimum wage hikes.  Sam
Prentice claims that my conclusions must be wrong because they don't match his
theory.  Science is done differently.  Evidence disproves theories, not the
other way around.

There have been two additional major studies.  The first (Jardim, et. al.,
http://bit.ly/2sdnLJo), using new methodologies which are credible but not yet
widely recognized, found some negative employment effects in Seattle from the
ongoing minimum wage hikes.  The second (Allegretto et. al.,
http://bit.ly/2FarW0l) examined six large cities, including Seattle and San
Francisco, using more widely accepted methodologies and found no such effects.

This discrepancy is common in social sciences research.  Usually, outlier
studies will not be replicated.  Occasionally, they reveal insights that change
the theory.  For now the bulk of the research, starting with a 1994 study by
Card and Krueger (http://bit.ly/2RzFIAf), confirms that minimum wage hikes do
exactly what they're intended to do: increase income for the poorest workers
while barely changing employment and inflation.

If Mr. Prentice wants to dispute this, his theory is not enough.  He really
needs to provide evidence.

On another topic, I apologize if I suggested that Mr. Prentice is more widely
read than he is.  The philosophy he expounds sounds so much like Ayn Rand's that
I assumed he had read her works.  I can't really recommend them; her writing is
far too didactic to make for readable novels.  But they are still some of the
most influential writings of the 20th century.

Finally, to Ed Kozlowski: I'm sorry if some progressive stole your girlfriend or
some such, but please remember that it wasn't Joe Stevens or me.
