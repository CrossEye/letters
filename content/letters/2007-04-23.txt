I don't know which would be more frightening: if Donald Denley actually believes
the innacurate nonsense he's peddling or if he thinks Andover residents are too
stupid to notice his lies. In any case, he once again has it all backwards.

To blame Steve Reade and Michelle Davidson for the prior administration's
mismanagement is ludicrous. I was not until Mr. Reade became chairman that the
Board of Finance uncovered the financial shenanigans of the former First
Selectman. It's clear that Mr. Denley longs for the days when Charlene Barnett
was running things, but the whole town remembers where that led.

Does Andover really want a representative who doesn't even understand the basics
of Property Revaluation? For the record, "reval" does not raise taxes; it
redistributes them. The grand list grew by 60%. Those whose property values grew
by less than 60% will benefit from the reval; those whose grew more will be
harmed by it. To blame Board members for the this state-mandated process shows
either staggering ignorance of fiscal matters or a cynical attempt to manipulate
voters.

Don Denley continually promotes himself as a some sort of conservative
bulwark against a conspiracy of those out to appropriate out money. He calls
himself a "saver" but he seems to mean "savior." Andovers voters are not fooled
any longer. There are six qualified candidates running for the Board of Finance.
Whether Mr. Denley is a cynical manipulator or just ignorant of financial
principles, he is not one of them.
