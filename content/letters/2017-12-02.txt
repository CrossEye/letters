It's amusing watching Sam Prentice attempt fact-checking when his own "facts"
are misinformed right-wing propaganda.

He talks about the definition of "mass shootings", claiming the FBI set, and
Congress altered, this definition.  He's mistaken.  There is no consensus
definition.  Perhaps he's confused by the FBI's "mass killings".  Our NRA-funded
Congress would never admit that firearms were related to killings.  There
statistics conflict due to this lack of consensus.  Incontrovertibly, though,
the US has far-and-away the highest per-capita firearm death-rate in the
developed world.

Mr. Prentice challenges the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, claiming it
was "established to be beyond the control of any constitutional authority."
Hogwash!  Congress created the CFPB and gave it a long leash, but they can alter
or abolish it.  It's subject to GAO audit, Congressional oversight, and Senate
confirmations.  The president can remove the chair for cause.  It's like any
number of federal agencies such as the SEC, FCC, and NLRB.  Courts affirmed
these in 1935.

There is controversy, and a DC Circuit Court panel -- in a case now under review
by that full court -- did say that this structure without a board of
commissioners is unconstitutional.  (That decision is long, but readable and
interesting: http://bit.ly/phh-vs-cfpb.) Even if this is sustained, it doesn't
invalidate the overall CFPB.  It's also worth noting that Senator Warren's
proposal included a board of commissioners.  I'm not sure how that changed.  (I
agree about their absurd building cost.)

Finally, Mr. Prentice uses a racist, insulting nickname for the Senator, riffing
on her "you didn't build this" speech.  That two-minute speech
(http://bit.ly/warren-fair-taxes) is perhaps the best explanation of progressive
thoughts on government's role in society.  Sam Prentice's best explanation seems
to be, "The rich are rich because they're better than others: just leave them
alone, okay?" I'll choose Elizabeth Warren, thanks.
