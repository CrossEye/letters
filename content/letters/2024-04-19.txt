Colin McNamara has taken offense to my fact-checking his letter by refering to
Snopes.

For those who don't know it, snopes.com is the definitive site for checking
urban legends.  It is also one of the premier political fact-checking sites,
although it has plenty of competitors in this, including factcheck.org and
politifact.com.  When I used Snopes references to discredit Mr. McNamara's post,
his response was simply to attack Snopes.  That there was infighting and
plagiarism among Snopes' founders does nothing to dispute the organization's
current prominent place among fact-checkers.

Snopes is a verified member of the International Fact Checking Network, which
means they're known to "exhibit a commitment to nonpartisanship and fairness,
transparency of sources, transparency of funding and organization, transparency
of methodology, and a commitment to open and honest corrections."

He claims that by labeling stories as false, Snopes (and Facebook) are censoring
stories and stifling dissent.  No, what Snopes is doing is something called
"journalism".  Those steeped in right-wing media may not recognize this term,
but it's an important way our society discovers and promote "truth", another
word that seems a little fuzzy to them.  Facebook, as I understand it, bans
little, but refuses to promote provably false dangerous stories.  He tries to
get snide, critiquing them for debunking a common myth, he misses the point:
"Sugar Causes Hyeractivity in Children" is widely believed, but is false
according to scientific research.

Two weeks ago, I rebutted three specific claims using references to
fact-checkers' articles.  That he still disagrees does not say anything about
fact-checkers, no matter how much he blames the messenger.  But it says a great
deal about him.

There is truth; I know it's hard for Mr. McNamara to accept it.  He really must
learn.  The truth is he was wrong, and Snopes demonstrated it.
