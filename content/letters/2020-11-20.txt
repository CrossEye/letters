How to pretend to win an argument: You say, "X is true." Your opponent says,
"No, here's the evidence against X." You say, "How can you possibly deny Y?"

When Sam Prentice says, "We're not a democracy" and I respond with arguments
demonstrating that we are in fact a democracy, what was his response? He says
that I am "disputing that we are a republic". This is plain dishonesty.

A republic is a government designed to benefit the people rather than its
leaders. That's all it means. Most countries currently are republics. A
democracy is a government in which the citizenry can, directly or through
representatives, choose the laws and leaders. There is no contradiction between
the two. The U.S. is both a republic (because we have no monarch) and a
representative democracy (because we elect our lawmakers and executives.)

The rest of his letter contains unsubstantiated claims of voting irregularities
and an unnecessary primer on federalism and the Electoral College. Yes, that's
how the Electoral College works. I'm simply suggesting that, as we've done
numerous times in the past, we should expand our democracy. Direct election of
the president would be a great way to
start.
