I'll say it again: if you want to know how progressives think, you should ask
one rather than to listen to Sam Prentice. I'm a progressive; let me set the
record straight. I think our Constitution is one of the greatest accomplishments
in history.

Our founders got astoundingly many things right. What they did best was to build
a living document, designed to change with the times. Madison's optimism that
people could adapt his Constitutional framework to the needs of their times
proved true. Jefferson's pessimism that each generation would need its own
revolution proved false.

Mr. Prentice, progressives do not believe in a controlling central authority. We
believe government is the banding together of its people to prevent the abuse of
the weak by the strong, ensuring that all get a fair shot at life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. Progressives want the government to prevent the rich
and powerful from rigging the system so they and their children have the best of
everything. We want the American dream available to all.

Similarly, if you want to know how scientists think, ask them instead of Sam
Prentice. If there are none handy, you can ask schoolchildren about the
scientific method. They will explain that science isn't the search for Truth;
that's left for theologians.

Scientists create theories about the natural world and make observations and
experiments that attempt to disprove them. The longer a theory withstands such
attempts, the more credible it becomes. Eventually a theory becomes established
as the consensus of the scientific community. That is the current state of the
theory that human activity is responsible for global warming. Tellingly, Mr.
Prentice only sees or only believes studies that support his ideology. He needs
to learn something from those schoolchildren.
