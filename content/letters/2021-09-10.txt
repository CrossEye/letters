Briefly, Gary Gile correctly cites damning facts about the FDA and about media
ownership, marred only by his unwarranted attacks on Dr. Fauci and by his
reference to notorious quack Joseph Mercola. It's worth noting that although he
discusses "mainstream media", the issue is much wider than suggested. Great
swaths of supposedly independent voices are also controlled by a tiny cadre of
the wealthy. It's long past time we reverse the media deregulation enacted under
Reagan and Clinton.

In our main topic, Peter Kushkowski uses the misleading phrase: "atheistic
science". Science does not take a stand on theism versus atheism. Science is
about statements we could prove false; it's impossible to falsify anything said
about omnipotent beings who might wish to hide their tracks... although Occam's
Razor does apply.

Science covers theories and the evidence to support them. Buddhists, Christians,
Hindus, Muslims, and others don't generally try to present evidence for their
beliefs. Nor do they often attempt to convince others of their own beliefs. When
they do it's usually circular reasoning (God is great because it says so in
scripture, and the scripture is right because it's the word of God) or sophism
like Pascal's Wager or the First Cause, nonsense scientists feel little need to
rebut.

The issues theists discuss overlap little with those of science. If you don't
ask scientists about faith or scripture and you don't ask a theologian to design
your nuclear reactor, you'll rarely go wrong. When someone brings up Intelligent
Design, it's not a scientific statement, merely religious creationism in
disguise.

I've stayed out of the firestorm Edmund Smith unleashed regarding religion and
science; I don't find it worth arguing. But it is entirely incorrect to assign
science to either side of the theism/atheism debate. It's simply not a question
relevant to science.
