There are varying levels of danger in recent diatribes.

At the lowest level we have the tripe Ed Kozlowski writes. He can do little more
than hurl insults and invent his own facts. He's so absurd that his diatribes
are mostly humorous.

Don Denley's diatribe is different. A former government official stole
top-secret material when vacating his office. In any other case, conservatives
would be calling for his head. But because the official is Donald Trump, Mr.
Denley attributes it all to politics. Never before, he said, has a president
been so mistreated. Well never before has a president been so deceitful and
traitorous. This diatribe is an attack on the rule of law, a fundamental tenet
of our democracy. (His comments on guns are of less concern; they're simply
lies. The past fifteen years of my letters are online. You can check for
yourself if I ever suggested confiscating guns:
http://letters.sauyet.com/#/search/gun. If he doesn't think an individual right
to bear arms includes tanks, it's up to him to explain where to draw the line:
cap guns, AR-15s, howitzers, nukes, where?)

As usual, Sam Prentice is in an entirely different category. His diatribes
threaten the existence of a livable planet. His claim: "We need more CO2, not
less." He wants you to think that he's an island of sanity in an ocean of
madness. All paranoid people think that. The overwhelming majority of scientists
believe that our release of greenhouses gasses, especially CO2, is heating our
planet at an alarming rate; I'll believe them unless Mr. Prentice demonstrates
amazing credentials. He tells us that CO2 levels used to be higher. That's true,
back when solar radiation was weaker and all life was single-celled. If he's
trying to hearken back to those times, then he's the most dangerous of the lot.
