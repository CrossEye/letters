Here's a little challenge to Rivereast readers.  Watch the New York Times video,
Day of Rage (https://nyti.ms/34VsZ3p) about Jan. 6, then reread Sam Prentice's
description of the events as "little more than a disruption at the Golden
Corral."   OK, done?  Now I ask you, is it the people decrying these events or
Mr. Prentice who seems a "hypocritical fraud"?  Yes, I thought so.  The video
consists entirely of footage from that event.  His letter consists entirely of
nonsense from right-wing websites.

He discusses two of the five deaths, includes lies from a doctored video
(http://link.sauyet.com/43), and proposes some obscure point about racism.  He
repeats debunked lies about Kamala Harris (http://link.sauyet.com/44), and then
draws ridiculous parallels with the George Floyd protests outside the White
House.  (I wonder why he worries about the bunker when Donald Trump said it was
only an inspection tour?)  I'd love to see his proof that perpetrators are being
held without hearings; a few accused of violence against police are being held
without bail, but that's very different.

We can find these claims on right-wing sites.  Echoing them back without any
skeptical investigation is, at the very best, intellectual laziness; but I
wouldn't rule out more nefarious interpretations.

And let's not forget Ed Kozlowski.  If he doesn't want to read Rauch's *The
Constitution of Knowledge*, which challenged some of my ideas and might
challenge some of his, that's fine.  Him,I didn't expect to bother trying to
learn something.  Others might find it worthwhile, though.  His remaining letter
is poppycock.  If he thinks he's attacking progressives by attacking Neil Young,
he should reconsider.  I'm not particularly a Neil Young fan.  And I care almost
as little about the entertainers' political opinions as I do about Mr.
Kozlowski's parroted right-wing conspiracy theories.  Almost.

An earlier version of this letter had bad links to two of the references.  The
ones pointing to my site, `link.sauyet.com`, were written with `https://...`
instead of `http://...`.  They are corrected now.  I've never bothered paying
for SSL certificates for my personal low volume site, but am investigating
doing so now so that this won't happen again.
