Termination of the Constitution?

This is the latest call from Donald Trump: "A Massive Fraud of this type and
magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles,
even those found in the Constitution." The response from Republican leaders?
...Crickets. Almost none of them would make any public rebuke. I wouldn't be
surprised if we hear nothing from from the pseudo-conservative Trump supporters
on these pages either. Note: a true conservative would be horrified, outraged.
Trump supporters are something other than conservatives, even if they've been
masked as conservative for years. Progressives like me are horrified and
outraged, of course, but that's nothing new with Trump.

This is not the stance of someone with either a conservative or a liberal
outlook. This is the stance of a narcissistic bully who, after getting away with
tantrums for years, has no idea what lines not to cross. It's sickening. The
only upside? It looks like Garland is closing in.
