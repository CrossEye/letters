Wendy Worley objects to my characterizing Jesus as a liberal. We can at least
ask how his lessons apply now. Before that, though: The standard theological
description is "fully human and fully divine". To deny full humanity is to deny
the meaning of the sacrifice on the cross.

Jesus of Nazareth hung out with the sick, the hungry, the prostitutes, and the
friendless. He taught a message of love and of service. He preached forgiveness
and compassion. He opposed public prayer and rigid legalisms.

"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man
to enter into the kingdom of God." ... "He that is without sin among you, let
him first cast a stone." ... "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least
of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

It's easy to imagine Jesus working in a soup kitchen or helping a social worker
find clothing for a poor family. Picture him banging nails next to Jimmy Carter.
But can you imagine him as an investment banker? Could you see him rallying
support for a stronger military? Would he promote mandatory sentencing laws for
drug users?

Whether we can apply "liberal" to Jesus, today it's liberals who carry forward
his teachings. Conservatives have a different agenda.

Meanwhile, back on the Rand-ch, Sam Prentice should realize that removing part
of a quotation to change its meaning is one of the lowest forms of intellectual
dishonesty. In our country -- he dropped that part -- the Left has been on the
correct side of history at every turn... think abolitionism, trade unionism,
women's suffrage, civil rights, gay rights. In all the major issues, the Left
has been on the side of reason and morality.
