Three quick responses to letters in the November 12 issue. First, to that most
elegantly literate Neanderthal, Margaret McCutcheon Faber: Thank you so much;
I've smiled all weekend long. Those upstart Cro-Magnons ain't got nothing on
you!

To Robert Kodym: You regular contributions to these pages are always worth
reading, if not necessarily for the reasons you intend. This last was more
inscrutable than usual, though. I have a question for you, and for all disciples
of Derrida. Did you realize that words can also be used to communicate with
others?

And, on a more serious note, to Dick Shea: Instead of assuming that your fellow
state residents incompetently voted against their own interests, shouldn't
you consider that perhaps they simply disagree with you? I'm on the other
side, fairly happy with the state results and disappointed with the national
ones. I find it distressing that nationally voters held the Democrats
accountable for not solving in two years the problems it took Republicans a
generation to create. But I won't imply that the other side is stupid or
incompetent. I wish you would extend us the same courtesy.
