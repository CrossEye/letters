Republican Candidates for any office should take note. There is a large
contingent of voters who won't vote for any Republican candidates whatsoever
unless they publicly disavow Donald Trump, his Big Lie, and the damage he and
his sycophants have inflicted on our nation and the world over the last three
decades.

Let me just name a few of the reasons:
