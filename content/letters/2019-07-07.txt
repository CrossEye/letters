John Adams says, "Facts are stubborn things."  I urged readers to learn about
climate change themselves.  Sam Prentice prefers they take his word for it.
He's wrong, as usual.

About the "non-existent" funding: The Union of Concerned Scientists tracks
Exxon-Mobile's pledge to stop funding denialism.  The results: Exxon-Mobile
spent "$36.13 million over the last 20 years". (http://bit.ly/ucs-exxon)  This
was easily surpassed by the Koch brothers, who supplied $127 million between
1997 and 2017. (http://bit.ly/koch-funding)  Similarly, prominent climate
skeptic Willie Soon is funded almost entirely through these groups.

Or the Hockey Stick controversy.  Always take Wikipedia with a grain of salt,
but it  cites the relevant research. (http://bit.ly/hockey-stick-wiki)  Yes,
Michael Mann et al had to issue a correction -- do you know how common that is
in journals? -- but it didn't affect the outcomes.  Nature thought the critique
didn't warrant its own space.

Then "hide the decline", denialists' favorite canard.  Mann graphed the
tree-ring proxy data and the sensor data on the same chart, demonstrating that
even when the proxy data started to become less predictive, the warming trends
continued.  When a researcher used the phrase "hide the decline", he was
discussing the decline in tree-ring growth from 1960.  Denialists claim this is
about declining temperatures in the decades since 1998.  Two points:
temperatures continued to rise in that period; the five hottest years were the
last five.  And that email was written in 1999!  Even if there had been a
decline, only Nostradamus could have known then.  Again, Wikipedia is a good
starting point.  (http://bit.ly/cru-emails)  The main take-away: "Eight
committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no
evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct."

Facts are stubborn things.  Chest thumping doesn't deter them.  Lies don't hide
them long.  And Sam Prentice's paranoid fantasies cannot make them go away.
