Fourth in a series discussing what progressives actually believe. Last time:
keeping the government in check.

Government and the rich are not the only sources of corrosive power that worry
liberals. Large corporations easily gain unwarranted power as well. Currently
American society has a laissez-faire attitude towards its corporations. That was
a major factor in the global economic meltdown and the Great Recession. Liberals
ever worry about the control such corporations gain over our day-to-day lives
and the power they clearly already maintain over our politics.

Corporations are not people. Regardless of what Congress and the courts say,
corporations don't bleed when you cut them. They don't feel anger or fear,
hunger or love. They allow individual benefits without individual
responsibility. (Or when did you last see a stockholder go to jail because of a
company's illegal activity?) Corporations are constructs made of laws and
contracts. They exist by public sufferance and should only be tolerated if on
balance they improve the public interest. Liberals recognize that corporations
have a lot of good to offer, but will not accept the ridiculous notion that
regulations are inherently anti-business, anti-American. Corporations are
tolerated because they are good for society; when they become a burden, they
must be altered or removed.

There's a theme here. We noted that the rich, left unchecked, will run roughshod
over everyone else. We noted that governments, left unchecked, will start
abusing the rights of its citizenry. We noted that large corporations, left
unchecked, will tend toward anti-consumer behavior. Progressivism is about
providing checks on these abuses of power.

In the end, progressivism is a simple concept: it's best to band together to
protect the weak from abuse by the strong so that everyone gets a fair chance at
the good things in life.

Next time: Teddy Roosevelt.
