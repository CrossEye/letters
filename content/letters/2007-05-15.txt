I seem to have offended Donald Denley in my recent letters to the editor.  He
complains of mud-slinging and smear tactics and says that my calling him a liar
was "disturbing, deeply offensive, low class and untrue."  I might be willing to
offer Mr. Denley an apology.

If Mr. Denley did not send the letter headlined "Ensure Stability" published
April 20 in the Rivereast under his name, then I heartily apologize for
mischaracterizing him.  That letter's mud-slinging and lies were themselves the
object of my ire.  The writer of that letter blamed Steve Reade and Michelle
Davidson for the financial mismanagement and deficit caused by the previous
administration, accused Reade and other Democrats of spin-doctoring, and made
several inaccurate claims, including that "most homeowners in Andover will pay
more taxes because of their revaluation."  That letter was insulting and
inaccurate.

If Mr. Denley did send that letter, I feel no need to apologize.  I stand by my
claim that whoever wrote that letter displayed "either a staggering ignorance of
fiscal matters or a cynical attempt to manipulate voters."

Don Denley wonders where I base my accusations, since he's rarely seen me at
Board of Finance meetings or had any contact with him whatever.  It's true that
I've rarely been at BOF meetings.  I've spent too much time at Board of
Education, Capital Improvement and Planning Commission, PTA, and town Website
Committee meetings to take additional time from my work or my family for the
BOF.  But I have seen Mr. Denley at those BOF meetings I did attend, at town
meetings, and at the one CIP meeting that Mr. Denley -- also a member -- managed
to attend.  The April 20 letter seemed in character with what I'd heard him say
in those other contexts.  It was this letter's inaccuracies and insults that
prompted me to write.

After Mr. Denley's words at the recent Town Meeting, and after his gracious May
11 letter, which were clearly at odds with the April 20 letter, it is certainly
possible that someone else wrote the one which inspired my rebuke.  If so, once
again, I apologize.
