Frank Blume and Don Denley suggest that Florida Governor Ron Desantis' shameful
immmigrants-to-Martha's-Vineyard stunt somehow reflected badly on the people of
Massachusetts. Let's review.

Desantis and Texas Governor Abbot conspired to round up Venezualan amnesty
seekers in Texas, convincing them that they had housing, jobs, child care, and
food lined up in Boston. They flew these people 2,100 miles from San Antonio to
Martha's Vineyard, then disappeared. There was no housing, no jobs, no child
care, and no food lined up for them. The governors hadn't even warned local
officials about the arrival. They spent $12,300 per immigrant for this stunt,
just on airfare. (Priceline says I can get a ticket from San Antonio to Martha's
Vineyard for $220.)

Mr. Blume claims the immigrants are suing the United States. This is not true.
They're suing Desantis, Florida, and Florida's Secretary of Transportation. I am
not a lawyer, but it's easy to believe that there is plenty of merit in this
lawsuit. Fraud and kidnapping come to mind.

He called these folks criminals. Wrong. These people are asylum seekers, who by
our law and international treaty, are here legally until their status is
determined. (Mr. Denley did get this right, using the odd phrase, "documented
visitors".) Given that they fled Venezuala, asylum seems likely.

Now how did the folks of Massachusetts react? They immediately got together
emergency housing, medical care, and food, brought toys for the kids, and
generally made them feel welcome. The governor quickly arranged longer-term
housing twenty miles north, and state agencies went to work finding ways to help
the immigrants.

Abbot and Desantis used these people as pawns in a political stunt. The people
of Martha's Vineyard treated them with respect and compassion; the government of
Massachusetts offered speedy assistance. Whose treatment do you think was
shabby?
