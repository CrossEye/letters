I heard a story so absurd even the Red Queen would not believe it.  It goes like
this:

"The Tweeter-in-Chief had a busy week.  He said he would change the Constitution
by fiat, revoking birthright citizenship and serving extra terms.

"He threatened to release ISIS fighters in Europe, because... because he was
about to attend the G7 summit in France?  He provoked a diplomatic row with
Denmark because they wouldn't sell him Greenland. Greenland's strategic benefit
is the waterways opening via global warming... which isn't happening. The Danish
Prime minister has a counteroffer.  She told Putin she would trade Greenland for
the United States.

"He also held an interesting debate on gun buyer background checks with...
himself two weeks earlier.

"He upped his China tariffs.  When China retaliated, he called his chosen
Federal Reserve chair an "enemy of the people."  It seems the Fed has ruined
America's economy, which, he simultaneously claims, is the best in history.

"He declared himself the King of Israel and the Chosen One, suggesting that
American Jews who vote for Democrats are disloyal -- to who or what he wouldn't
specify.

"He has a solution to the spate of veteran suicides, a ketamine-based drug that
we'll buy in large quantities or convince the makers to give to us for free.

"For all this hard work, this draft-dodger will give himself the Medal of
Honor."

Someone needs to tell Lewis Carroll that giant Rabbits and Mad Hatters are one
thing, but this fantasy is too ridiculous.
