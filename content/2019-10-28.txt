An old legal saying: "If you have the facts on your side, pound the facts. If
you have the law on your side, pound the law. If you have neither on your side,
pound the table."

Dan Armstrong is pounding the table.

He challenges the 97% consensus on anthropogenic global warming by criticizing
one portion of one of the dozen large-scale studies from the past two decades,
all finding consensus between 90% and 100% agreement, mostly centered around
97%. He complains that this study ignored papers which didn't take a stand.

Perhaps he has a valid complaint; the denialist community has certainly harped
on that for years. However, the study proceeded to ask scientists to
specifically state their stance, and again 97% agreed with the consensus
formulation. There is an obvious reason most papers do not make an explicit
stand: it's the same reason that astronomical papers don't take an explicit
stand on the Big Bang. Other studies with differing methodologies have
concurred. Wikipedia is a good starting place for the research:
