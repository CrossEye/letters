We post sentries to inform us of coming troubles.  Early-detection of
danger is a critical form of protection.  However sentries can be
undermined by calling them alarmists, increasing our danger
immeasurably.

Scientific consensus describes the dangers of climate change: human
activity steering us toward ecological disaster.  Sam Prentice wants
you to believe these sentries are alarmists.

One way to discredit sentries is through distraction.  Here's one
form: "the norm of CO2 atmospheric volume in 4.5 billion years of
geological history is near 3000 ppm.  Our current level of 400 ppm
pales in comparison."  The naive might be impressed by this.  The
cynical might doubt his figures.  But it's quite accurate... and a
complete distraction.

Greenhouse gases trap solar radiation in the atmosphere.  Years ago,
solar radiation was weaker than today.   Additional greenhouse gases
kept the planet temperate.  More importantly, for 90% of that time
there were no air-breathing animals!  Perhaps Sam Prentice would
prefer a world where all creatures were single-celled?.  More relevant
is the few million years of human existence, in which CO2 levels were
never this high.

Beyond distraction to fabrication, Mr. Prentice got all these matters
wrong:  (1) Global ice volume actually is decreasing substantially.
(2) Storm frequency and intensity are increasing.  (3) Coral reefs are
dying.  (4) Heat waves are happening much more often because of global
warming.  (5) Global temperatures are rising far beyond any "urban
heat island" effect.  These facts are easy to look up.  These
denialists have no more credibility than Holocaust deniers.

Denialism is funded by the fossil fuel industry.  We didn't believe
the tobacco executives denying links between smoking and cancer.  No
more should we believe these oil shills.  Our sentries are doing
important work; don't let such idiocy defame them.  Claims of
conspiracy theorists aren't worth a grain of salt.
