Sam Prentice gets it wrong again. Yes, some of the founders (notably Adams and
Hamilton) were suspicious of democracy. Others (Jefferson, Paine) were
sympathetic. Within a generation, we were regularly described as a democracy.
Many great quotes on democracy came from Jackson, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, and
Reagan.

The 14th, 15th, 17th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th Amendments and arguably various
others, expanded our democratic features. Yes, we have democracy-limiting checks
and balances, but we've gradually grown more accustomed to "a government of the
people, by the people, and for the people."

The recent conservative mantra about not being a democracy defends remaining
anti-democratic provisions: the Electoral college and state's equal weighting in
the Senate. This is ideology trying to retain power, nothing more.

Mr. Prentice cites the Federalist Papers in defending the Electoral College.
(Odd, isn't it, how small-government conservatives love to promote the
Federalist Papers whose sole purpose was to argue for a more powerful, more
centralized government?) The relevant one, #68, described a collection of
deliberative bodies, nothing resembling the modern Electoral College. 2016
embodied the complete failure of Hamilton's goals.

We are a democracy. We'd become a better one by eliminating the Electoral
College.
