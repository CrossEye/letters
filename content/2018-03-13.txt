Dan Devin calls my letter a rant. That's fair; I think his is pure sophistry,
spinning facts to fit a ridiculous narrative.

Spin: I described the Republican Party's degradation into serving the
ultra-rich, Mr. Devin's response? Discussing the money given to Democrats. He
quotes a study (based on opensecrets.org data) cherry-picking information to
make it look like labor unions donate as much as corporations.

Fact: OpenSecrets contradicts this (http://bit.ly/biz-labor): "Whatever slice
you look at, business interests dominate, with an overall advantage over
organized labor of about 15-to-1." Mr. Devin ignores my main point, that the
national Republican party is laser-focused on policies benefitting only their
megarich donors.

Spin: Responding to my lament about Republican deference to the gun lobby, Dan
Devin notes how little the NRA donates to Federal candidates.

Fact: The NRA's political spends mostly on member communications and political
ads: fifty times as much on political ads as on donations. It focuses on the
states. Moreover, the NRA is only a part of the gun lobby. Again, this misses
the main point: even with astounding gun violence and massive support for
change, Republican lawmakers vote in lock-step with the gun lobby.

Spin: I'd pointed out that we had an impeachment centered on "the sexual conduct
of [Bill Clinton]." Mr. Devin responds with legalisms about the articles of
impeachment claiming perjury and obstruction of justice.

Fact: The charges came
from an investigation into a land deal in Arkansas, turned to the firing of
White House travel agents, then turned to alleged misuse of FBI files before
turning to President Clinton's affair with an intern. This was clearly an
attempt to find some charge. Those articles didn't mention anything salacious,
but his sexual misconduct underlaid them. The Trump impeachment will also use
words like "perjury" and "obstruction", but it will actually be based on
"incompetence", "abusiveness", "perfidy", perhaps even "treason".
