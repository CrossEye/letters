According to Dan Armstrong, "the government cannot give one dollar to anyone
without first taking that dollar from its rightful owner through coercion."

I urge Mr. Armstrong to resettle somewhere he and like-minded citizens do not
have to shoulder this burden.  They can find an island somewhere or convince one
of our great states to forgo government.

He would face some issues.  To guard his property, he should hire armed guards.
Getting to the market will be challenging.  While he and his neighbors will
agree that there should be roads, they won't agree on where, and none will be
able to afford to build them alone.

He must decide whether to bring his parents.  They are too old to work.  It
could be expensive to house, clothe, and feed them. However, he has little
choice about his children.  Finding tutors is expensive, but it's worth it to
keep their little minds limber and free.

If the community upriver dumps their toxins into the waterway, I'm sure he'll
agree that such is their right.  I'm not sure how he'll water his crops or what
he'll drink, but freedom has its price.

His utopia will also attract those who want to take it from him.  He may have to
pay protection money to self-funding armies, hoping the other side doesn't pay
more.  Similarly, he must hope that when he hires a roving judge that his rival
can't pay better than he.

Perhaps these folks could band together, pool some money to hire teachers,
provide support for the retired, keep the land's air and water clean, protect
them from invaders and ruffians, maintain shared infrastructure, and offer fair
judgment between disputants.  That is what a government does.  That is where its
taxes go.  But he can call it something different.  We don't mind.
