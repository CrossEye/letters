Inauguration addresses are traditionally times to heal divisions, to bring our
country together.  But our new president's angry speech lied about many things:

  - Crime. The truth: the violent crime rate is half of what it was 25 years 
    ago.

  - Jobs. The truth: the unemployment rate is below historic averages; we've had
    75 consecutive months of job increases.

  - Welfare. The truth: welfare roles dropped by 27% under President Obama and
    by 75% in the past 20 years.

  - Immigration. The truth: illegal immigration has dropped by 75% in the last
    15 years; we've doubled the border guard count.

The day after the inauguration, the president's press secretary made multiple
unsolicited lies obscuring facts about inauguration attendance.  The president's
counselor then explained that they weren't lies but "alternative facts".

"Alternative facts?"  This from an adult?  From someone in a position of power?

We're in for years of this, folks.  When the boss is allergic to the truth, his
underlings shy away from it.

So do fans writing letters here.  To Victor Carli: there is no reasonable
definition by which we can call Donald Trump's win a "landslide".  He lost by
2.8 million votes.  He won the electoral college by smaller margins than 75% of
our presidents.

You need to check your facts.  Secretary Clinton's private email server was
never hacked.  The hacking was of an aide's GMail account and the DNC's server.
Mr. Carli, you say the fact that the Russians hacked them is irrelevant.  In
other words, it's irrelevant that a hostile foreign power was actively and
effectively influencing our election.  Do you consider yourself a patriot?

Finally, one wag noted the sad truth: "Peaceful transitions of power are
amazing.  One moment, Barrack Obama was the leader of the free world.  The next
one, Angela Merkel was."
