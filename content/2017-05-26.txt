A new race is brewing.  Victor Carli challenges Sam Prentice's
long-held local reign as champion conspiracy nut.  But Prentice is
hard to beat.  Remember how badly Chuck Corso fared last time around?
If you come out for this contest, don't forget your bug spray.  Gadfly
season is upon us!

Carli starts strong: mentioning that our so-called president "is in
office, he can do what he wants."  Really?  In "a government of laws,
not of men"?  It's a powerful opening shot, which he follows with, "he
has the support of the MAJORITY of Americans."  A totally false
statement, unsupported by the polls, and enhanced with capital letter
shouting.  It might be hard for Prentice to top this!

But Prentice won't take it lying down.  Out of the blue, he brings up
long-disproven Vince Foster conspiracy theories.  Vince Foster!  We
haven't seen this folderol in fifteen years!  Does the kid even know
what hit him?

Prentice's follow-up is straightforward.  He challenges the integrity
of several of our most respected news institutions, insinuating that
they fabricated a certain memo, but then speculating on the content of
the memo.  This illogic makes for an inspired conspiracy move.

But Carli's response is derivative, calling the media "socialist", as
if that's an insult, and regurgitating conservative media lies as
though they're obvious and true.

Prentice's knockout blow comes quickly.  While accusing others of
projecting, he actually brings up confirmation bias!  From someone who
shuns the majority of the news media, crediting only right wing
nonsense, this is a superlative power play!

Once again, we have a winner!  This should surprise no one.  It's
really hard to top the man who for years claimed that global warming
was a liberal conspiracy to control peopleâ€™s lives.  But Carli gave a
good shot.  And there's always next month...
