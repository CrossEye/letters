So much nonsense; so few words for rebuttal.

Last week started with a letter decrying teachers' complaints. Sure, they have
it easier than nurses. But they correctly note that distance learning is
difficult. Their complaints are for their students, not themselves. If you're
going to compare complainers, how about the bar owner raging against public
health restrictions? His tantrums could kill people.

Then we have pro-police letters. They don't recognize that protesters understand
that most police officers are not monsters. But we've all seen the videos. Too
many departments are overly violent; that violence is especially directed at
black men. When asked to support breast cancer research, you don't retort, "All
cancers matter!" Don't respond to Black Lives Matter that way. Too many police
act as though black lives matter less than others', especially horrifying
because they are supposed to serve and protect.

Next, our usual suspects pretend to independent thought; examine the letters
from Sam Prentice and Ed Kozlowski (and from Susan Demma) and ask whether
they're parroting the same right-wing ideologues. BLM is about police violence.
People can be upset about Chicago's violent weekend and bothered or not about
abortion and still be horrified by police killing black men. Most of us can
actually hold multiple different ideas simultaneously! Regarding Mr. Kozlowski's
hydroxychloroquine nonsense, the problem is not with the drug, but that our
so-called president promotes it, against scientific evidence, against FDA
guidelines, against common sense, because, as always, he thinks he knows more
than the experts. This is like his suggesting bleach.

Finally, we hear from the Grassy Knoll contingent. It seems Covid is a Chinese
plot to avenge an economy decimated by Donald Trump's subtle machinations. If
you believe that, I know this Nigerian prince...

This has been this week's 300 words against right-wing propaganda.
