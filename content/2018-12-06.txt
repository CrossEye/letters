Joe Stevens needs no help defending himself, not against Ed Kozlowski, who sees
self-aggrandizement in Mr. Steven's thoughtful analysis, or against Don Denley,
who misstates statistics and mis-assigns blame. So we'll return to our old
standby: refuting the Randian.

I've suggested that if you want to know how liberals think, you should ask one.
The same goes for Democrats. Sam Prentice knows little about either.

If you haven't read Ayn Rand's fantasies, you might not recognize their
influence on Mr. Prentice.  His latest missive seem rooted in the idea that
Ellsworth Toohey, an over-the-top caricature of a false friend, from Rand's The
Fountainhead, is the heart of every Democrat. It suggests that Wesley Mouch from
Atlas Shrugged, an envious, incompetent buffoon with too much power, is their
brain.

Sam Prentice really should remember that these are works of fantasy. Most
thinking folks get over sophomoric fascinations with Ayn Rand by age 25.  It's
unseemly in someone older.

Democrats do not promote equality of outcomes.  However, they are likely to
promote equality of opportunity, with policies designed to reduce structural
inequalities, especially regarding children. Lately, Republicans are the
opposite.  See the tax bill, which barely helps most people, and then only
temporarily, but gives large permanent cuts to the wealthy and corporations.

Finally we come to the minimum wage.  Mr. Prentice repeats his 2015 assertions
about minimum wage hikes.  He provides no evidence because he cannot.  The best
study of these issues was  done by Dube, Lester, and Reich in 2010
(http://bit.ly/1HSIxMA).  An easier-to-read summary was by John Schmitt in 2013
(http://bit.ly/1eWItVi). The results are conclusive: there is, "no statistically
significant negative employment effects of the minimum wage."  Nor did minimum
wage hikes substantially change wages higher up the pay scale.

Looking at the world through Rand-colored glasses is pure fantasy.
