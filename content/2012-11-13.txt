Some people, when presented with actual facts that contradict their
opinions, own up to their mistakes.  I've given up on Chuck Corso.
He'd rather make up insulting nicknames or stick his fingers in his
ears and pretend he can't hear, or engage in other grade-school
behavior.

I'm hoping that Richard Lindstrom will be able to admit his mistake.
He was taken in by a hoax email circulating regarding executive
orders.  I'd suggest that when something outrageous like this comes
along, the recipient should do a little research before passing it on,
especially in a letter to the editor.  Such research should not be
through a biased news outlet, such as MSNBC on the left or Fox, which
might as well be the propaganda department of the Republican Party.
There are plenty of non-partisan fact-checking organizations out
there.  My personal choice for urban legend checking is a website
called snopes.com.  For politics, I choose FactCheck.org.  But there
are many other equally worthy ones.

FactCheck.org recently debunked the email Lindstrom was obviously
quoting:  http://www.factcheck.org/2012/09/obamas-executive-orders/.
Snopes also reports it as false:
http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/executiveorders.asp.

What's really amusing is that Obama in fact has the fewest executive
orders of any president since Chester Arthur, according to the
American Presidency Project.  Instead of the 923 Lindstrom cited, this
site says there are 138, although I believe there has been one more
issued since their data was collected on Sept. 20.  You can see the
entire list at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php.

Please, folks, take a moment to think over this sort of email.  If it
seems outlandish, designed to boil your blood, perhaps it in fact was
intentionally designed exactly that way.
