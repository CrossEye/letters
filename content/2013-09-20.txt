Dan Devin makes two odd points. He attempts to discredit progressivism by
pointing out that that certain progressives from history were not perfect
people, or that they might not be considered progressives by modern standards.
And he writes, with no evidence whatsoever, as though those of us promoting
progressive and liberal ideas are wedded to the Democratic Party.

Yes, Woodrow Wilson and Margaret Sanger had deep flaws. (I knew little about
George Bernard Shaw's politics, and a casual reading about the issue leaves me
in some doubt about Mr. Devin's characterization.) But ad hominem has never been
a persuasive argument. That these people had ideas that were not liberal in no
way impugns liberalism itself.

And as to party politics, I don't give a fig about which party houses the
liberals; that's the party for me. These days the Democrats are generally more
progressive than the Republicans, but it hasn't always been that way. I'm ready
to vote for whoever has the ideas that best match mine, including the Green
Party or, on occasion, the Libertarians.

And speaking of Libertarians, Sam Prentice has -- once again -- no point to
make. Just because he wants to reserve the word "liberal" for what is usually
these days called "libertarian" doesn't mean that anyone else is going to go
along with him.
