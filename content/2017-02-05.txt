Another week, another bag of lies from Sam Prentice.

When a right-winger accuses "the media" of corruption and sycophancy, you have
to blame the steady diet of lies they've consumed from conservative echo
chambers.  It warps their judgment.

When he -- again -- calls Donald Trump's win a "landslide" is he lying, is he
being a dupe for the so-called president's propaganda or is he incapable of
realizing that 46th of 58 is in the bottom 25%, nothing like a landslide?

When he thinks he sees into the hearts of progressives, he is badly misinformed.
Most of us love our country, but recognize both the good and the bad. Sam
Prentice probably does as well, even if we disagree about which is which.

I can't speak for Joe Stevens, but my notion of "unfettered capitalism" has to
do with robber barons, river pollution, Pinkerton union busting, credit default
swaps: things companies do to serve their own self-interest at the expense of
society's.  Society has an obligation to intervene.

Most absurd is the contention that electing Trump is a step away from
authoritarianism when it is so obviously a leap towards it.

An accusation of sophistry from Mr. Prentice brings to mind pots and kettles.
As I do often for conservative gadflies, I rebutted misstatements with actual
facts, making no editorial stand.  But, in fact, I don't believe Secretary
Clinton is particularly dishonest or corrupt, nor do the leaked emails
demonstrate anything like that.  She is a typical politician, not as trustworthy
as an Obama or a Carter, but not nearly as bad as a Nixon or the current
president, likely the most dishonest person ever to serve.

Briefly, to Dan Devin: the Democrats would be much more amenable if Mr. Trump
presented qualified nominees..
