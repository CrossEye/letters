Chuck Corso has a problem completing his thoughts.  I thought I might be able to
help out.

He notes that "Arctic Ocean ice is up 42% in the last two years,‚Äù He obviously
forgot the second clause in that sentence, which should read, "to what is the
sixth lowest level ever recorded, well below normal values."  This is called
cherry-picking one's data; it would get you kicked out of the news-room at a
reputable newspaper.  The full data, with useful graphs of the trend-lines is at
http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/.

He also says that "Progressives have controlled American cities for over a half
century and have run the school systems into the ground." He forgot to report
the other half, that "Conservatives have been running such states as Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana for generations, and these states have the very worst
educational records."  This is called false-cause ("correlation does not imply
causation"); the debate team would eat you alive for it.  His hypothesis seems
extremely sketchy.  It would benefit us to search for a different cause.  Dare
we suggest investigating the links of educational achievement and poverty?

Mr. Corso tells us that Joe Stevens' letters "are a weekly, personal attack on
letter writers he disagrees with."  Again he forgets the subordinate clause, in
which he should have added, "as of course, are all of mine."  This is called
hypocrisy.  I've just reread the last several months of letters.  Mr. Stevens
writes sharply about the published philosophy of conservatism and the results
this philosophy has on our society.  He very rarely stoops to name-calling.  Mr.
Corso, on the other hand, does almost nothing but insult others.

So there you have it, three half-completed thoughts now finished. You're quite
welcome, Mr. Corso.
