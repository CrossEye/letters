s it time to return from my hiatus?  What's been discussed?

Sam Prentice makes the usual attacks on climate scientists, bemoans
progressivism, claiming that America's problem is hatred directed
AGAINST Trump and his supporters (entirely backward!).  He correctly
notes that the Democrats were once the racist party.  Of course it was
the liberals that got things right, regardless of party.

Victor Carli continues to misrepresent others.  It's hard to know if
he's a real person or an escaped pro-Trump Twitterbot.  Amusingly, his
argument against global warming boils down to, "You see, the sun is
hot.  Really hot."  He's joined by Victor Congdon and Renzo Carli in
misunderstanding basic science.

Then there's Dan Armstrong, who clearly never got over that time when
he was six and Socialists took some of his candy to give to a kid who
had none.

Don Denley thinks Dannel Malloy worse than John Rowland, that Clinton
is a lying whiner but Trump an honest, forceful leader. Anyone
surprised that public corruption concerns him less than how policies
affect his wallet?

They're supported by Dan Devin, who misreads history; by Richard Barningham, 
who only notices those debts incurred by Democrats; and by
Lambros Lambrinides, whose lesson on the Korean war concludes, "The
United States is now confronted with a bonafide psycho who is so far
out on a ledge I don't think he can come back."  Honestly, I simply
assumed he meant Trump.

The other side is represented with grace and humor by Joe Stevens and
Ed Smith.  They are easily able to handle the conservative nonsense,
yet still got backup from Colleen Shaddox and James Monahan.

The sides are chosen: nine conservatives versus four liberals.  I
guess I won't jump back in.  This in not a fair fight.  They're going
to need a *lot* more conservatives.
