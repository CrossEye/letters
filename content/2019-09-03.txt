Dan Armstrong argues that the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate
change is exaggerated, listing academics who challenge that consensus. I planned
a parody letter, listing professors rejecting evolution or promoting flat-earth
theories. It could have been amusing. But instead, over a few letters I will
discuss the scientists Mr. Armstrong has presented. First, a few words about
science.

Mr. Armstrong says, "Predicting future events based on past events is not
experimentally proven science; it is statistical forecasting." No, creating
prediction models is exactly what science does, combining past events and
theoretical understanding in varying proportions. For sciences like Newtonian
mechanics we create experiments; others, like cosmology, are much harder to
verify experimentally. Always, though, science is about creating predictive and
resilient models.

Noting that weather models are inherently complex and accurate over only short
terms, Mr. Armstrong asks how much more complex climate models must be: how
could we know they're accurate? Well, models of larger phenomena smooth the
smaller systems. With non-linear feedback and turbulence, fluid dynamics is
extremely complex. Predicting the waves would be impossible, right? Yet we have
precise and accurate tide charts far in advance. It's similar with climate and
weather. Climate is driven by different inputs than weather; many trends can be
modeled. It's not easy; climate models are certainly complex. But it's not the
impossible task Dan Armstrong claims.

Another letter suggests there's no true consensus because many scientists and
scholars disagree. This is incorrect; there is a very strong consensus. That
does not imply unanimity, but by most counts at least 97% of climate scientists
agree that global temperature is rapidly rising, that humans are a substantial
cause. Of 54,195 peer-reviewed papers studied between 1991 and 2015, only five
rejected the consensus. And the agreement increases with climate expertise. The
Wikipedia article (http://bit.ly/agw-consensus) links to relevant research.
