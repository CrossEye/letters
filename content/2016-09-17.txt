It's been difficult to write a letter about Donald Trump. True, he is the
greatest danger to our republic since the Civil War. True, he has spewed racism,
xenophobia, misogyny, and ever imaginable form of bigotry throughout the
campaign. True. he doesn't know the difference between the truth and his own
lies. True, he's a narcissistic cry-baby. True, his history in business is one
of cheating and abuse. True, he openly idolizes strongmen and dictators.

But none of that really captures why I'm so horrified by Mr. Trump's candidacy.
It's more personal than that.

I'm bothered because I love my country. I believe the United States was founded
by true idealists; I believe we still mostly live by those ideals of freedom and
tolerance, of openness and collaboration.

A country that elects Donald Trump has forgotten those ideals.

My two children are entering early adulthood. What would it say to them if they
country they are now being asked to help watch over were lead by an egomaniacal
bully with no qualifications for office, only the abilities to belittle others,
run businesses into the ground, lie about every topic he encounters, and
shamelessly promote himself? I don't know. I think the only thing America could
do for them is to apologize.

Let's not let it get to that.
