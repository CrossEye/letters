It's come to this: recent polling found that 32% of Trump voters do
not believe that Donald Trump, Jr. had a meeting with a Russian lawyer
about information potentially harmful to Hillary Clinton.  He
published this information himself! It was widely reported; but they
are in such denial they simply won't let facts overcome their
hero-worship.

Our own Sam Prentice is a prime example.  In response to this news, he
presented an incoherent conspiracy theory involving the FISA court,
the State Department, the DNC, and an opposition research firm, as
well as the Clintons, Barack Obama, John McCain, Christopher Steele,
James Comey, the Russian lawyer, an ambassador, and someone's in-laws.
He tosses all these together asking if we "smell a rat."  I do, but I
think we disagree about the odor's origin.

Such nonsense was once confined to the lunatic fringe.  It's
distressing to see just how wide that fringe has grown.

Briefly, regarding Victor Carli: if his facts about the sun's massive
power were the most relevant ones, then the Moon would be as warm as
the earth.  The difference?  Atmosphere.  And if he thinks science is
done by mathematical proof, then he knows nothing about science... or
math.  But then, we could have deduced that from his obsession with
one particular month when the temperature dropped: February, 2014 was
.2 degrees cooler than the previous month, but still .41 degrees
higher than normal.  This one month does nothing to contradict the
trend anywhere but in Mr. Carli's imagination.
