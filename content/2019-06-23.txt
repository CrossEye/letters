I quote: "All it takes to get our resident progressives out of the tall grass is
to criticize [...] global warming".  Yes, when human life is threatened, we take
notice.

The scientifically ignorant deny anthropogenic warming.  We bother responding to
their nonsense only because it's so dangerous.  We might poke fun at their
belief in Voodoo Economics, Infallible Founders, Invisible Hands, and the Tooth
Fairy, but the  influence of climate denier propaganda is more pernicious.  It
suppresses civilization's ability to face its most serious crisis.  That's what
gets us out of our peaceful tall grass meadows: we're trying to prevent a
catastrophe.

I urge readers to investigate this themselves. They'll learn that the Hockey
Stick challengers quickly came to acceptance and that the "Hide the Decline"
foofaraw was merely an unfortunate word choice.

The data is completely consistent: global warming is a grave threat to human
life.  The conspiracy theorist arguments denying it rest on extremely suspect
oil industry "research".  They try to confuse us by claiming their opposition
doesn't understand basic science: however, yes, we understand the carbon cycle;
acting as though anyone said anything to suggest otherwise is classic
misdirection.  These folks are dangerous.

... Briefly, to last week's other liberal-basher: Clinton was investigated and
the FBI found no criminal activity; Trump was investigated and although the FBI
found eleven credible counts of obstruction, prosecution was forbidden.  See the
difference?  Fixing the Electoral college is not to "assail the popular vote";
it is to elevate it.  The documented long-term effects of alcohol and tobacco
are much more severe than those of marijuana; why aren't they banned? You also
talk the about liberals' party.  I can only assume you means the Green Party;
but if so, you're confused about its candidates. Perhaps some research is in
order next time?
