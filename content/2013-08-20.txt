Sam Prentice is at it again. He runs down progressivism as though it were a form
of social collectivism. The straw man he's tearing down is not one that those of
us proud to call ourselves liberals and/or progressives even recognize.

It's pretty simple, actually. Progressives do believe in the efficacy of working
together. "Two heads are better than one," and "Many hands make light work,"
ring true for progressives. But this has nothing to do with central planning or
government control. I don't know what "cadre of elites" he thinks we plan on
foisting on him, but it's never been discussed at the secret cabal meetings I've
attended!

Instead, progressives believe in banding together to protect the weak from
abuses by the powerful. We believe in ensuring equal opportunity for everyone.
We believe in individual rights, in pluralism, in toleration for one another's
differences. But we're suspicious of centralized power -- note that this is a
liberal idea -- believing that power too often corrupts.

The caricature that Sam Prentice presents has nothing to do with reality. So
what else is new?
