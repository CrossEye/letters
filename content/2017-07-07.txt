It's impressive how many falsehoods can be packed into one letter. Last week one
writer said:

  - **Lie**: Donald Trump won a landslide victory.
  - **Truth**: He lost the popular vote by 2.8 million; his electoral win
    percentage was smaller than 45 of the preceding 57 elections.

----------

  - **Lie**: Judge Robart was appointed by an ultra left winger.
  - **Truth**: Few people would call George W. Bush left-wing.

----------

  - **Lie**: The 9th Circuit Court has 80% of its decisions overturned.
  - **Truth**: The Supreme Court only reviews about 0.1% of appellate cases,
    and of this small fraction, it reverses 70%.  The 9th is higher than
    average, but two courts have higher percentages.

----------

  - **Lie**: The country almost unanimously thinks the media treats Donald
    Trump unfairly.
  - **Truth**: Recent polls split 43/42 in favor of fair treatment.

----------

  - **Lie**: The Harvard Report says that 70 percent of Americans think the
    media is leftist.
  - **Truth**: The Harvard report simply says the 70% of the coverage of
    Donald Trump is negative.  That no more implies bias than negative
    coverage of the home team; it depends on how they're actually doing.

----------

  - **Lie**: There are 100 million Republicans.
  - **Truth**: Of the 200 million registered voters, 40% are independents, a
    small number in minor parties, and the others roughly split between
    Democrats and Republicans, implying fewer than 60 million Republicans.

----------

  - **Lie**: Democrats (including Clinton, Kaine, Schumer, and Pelosi) have
    a history of murdering Republicans, threatening murder, looting,
    rioting and destroying personal property.
  - **Truth**: Really, is there any reason to respond to this folderol?

----------

Additionally, this letter horribly misrepresents my views and letters, even,
amidst all these lies, calling me a liar!

It's possible these are not lies: if the author is terribly uninformed and under
the influence of an extremist ideology.  I can't tell which one it is.  Might it
be both lying and ignorance?
