I can't tell if Sam Prentice can't read or is simply lying. A casual reading of
my last letter demonstrates that I did not call Fox News anti-vaccination.  I
criticized Fox only for editorial malfeasance.

He is correct that I don't watch Fox.  However, I read it online and stand by my
contention that while most major news sites strive to be even-handed, Fox
doesn't even try.

Mr. Prentice calls fact-checking journalists "left-wing hacks".  This says
nothing about the fact-checkers, whose bona fides are obvious. It tells us
plenty about Sam Prentice.  Neutral fact-checkers FactCheck.org, snopes.com,
Politifact.com, and others ensure that politicians' claims are verified and
repudiated when false.  If he sees a liberal conspiracy in honest truth-seeking,
it is his problem, not these journalists'.

Mr. Prentice says others lie as much as much as our so-called president; this
should be easy to show.  Numerous reputable sources tally Donald Trump's lies.
I challenge Sam Prentice to find public figures outside the Administration with
such abysmal records.

Democrats, he said, "have no message other than their hatred of Trump."  Again,
a lie.  Watch pretty much any Democratic candidate out there, and you'll see
that they're talking about health care, the economy, wages, the environment, and
ICE's abuses.  Disdain for Trump is not the central message.

Mr. Prentice's lies about the economy are also easy to check.  Look at ten-year
charts of important numbers such as unemployment, wages, GDP, deficits,
manufacturing employment.  You'll see the gains since Mr. Trump's first budget
took effect last October -- or even since he took office -- are simply
continuations of long trends started under Mr. Obama.

Sam Prentice repeats the lies of the right-wing media, seemingly without any
filters.  The thing is, it's really easy to find the truth.  It starts by
turning off Fox.
