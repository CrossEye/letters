Sam Prentice is confused.  He says the National Popular Vote Compact (NPV)
proposal is contorted.  Actually, it's very simple: it awards the popular vote
winner the presidency.

Compare it to now:  We do not vote for the president.  We elect a slate of
electors who choose the president.  They can choose anyone. The number of
electors varies unevenly: a Vermont voter has 2.4 times the influence of a
Connecticut voter.  If the electors cannot reach a majority decision, the
election goes to the House, which must choose one of the top three electoral
candidates.  Here there's just one vote per state. State delegations must
themselves first agree; if they can't, they get no vote.

Mr. Prentice thinks this system is simpler than the one-person, one-vote of the
NPV.  Really?

Alexander Hamilton argued that the Electoral College would assure the Presidency
was not granted to "any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the
requisite qualifications."  And it would stymie "the desire in foreign powers to
gain an improper ascendant in our councils."  The recent election showcased the
Electoral College failing at this.  It's past time to replace it.

The NPV is not the best way to do that; better would be a Constitutional
amendment.  We have had five amendments that changed the form of our elections.
Another is not politically feasible right now, but the NPV allows the states to
use their Constitutional authority to enact this democratic reform.  The
Constitution does not mandate winner-take-all.

Sam Prentice calls this a Progressive notion.  He's misguided again. There are
liberal and conservative sponsors, Republican and Democratic votes.  Supporters
are simply those who feel that true democracy is more important than
eighteenth-century federalism.

So, Mr. Prentice, can you explain why majority win is complex?
