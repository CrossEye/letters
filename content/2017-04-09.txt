To respond to Victor Carli or not? I shouldn't let his misrepresentations about
my letter stand. However, his reply contains no meaningful content, only
ridiculous insults. Should I bother when he can't recognize a simple rhetorical
technique or when he calls lies opinions and their corrections insults? Should I
explain that I don't hate conservatism, but despise hypocrisy and mendacity?
It's probably not worth the effort.

Instead, let's continue discussing what Washington Republicans are doing to our
country. Their recent law allows Internet Service Providers to sell personal
data to anyone. Our browsing history, our locations, even our smart appliance
information are fair game.

Republicans react to the Russian-election-meddling investigation by concocting
stories about Obama officials. Devin Nunes is now discredited, the insinuations
about Susan Rice have been disproven, and the wiretapping tweets refuted. Surely
Donald Trump will make some new attempt to distract. Is this the reason we
bombed Syria?

These aren't the worst thing Republicans are doing: they're gutting the
Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA ensures that the air we breathe is
safe, the land we inhabit is free of toxins, and the water we drink -- and
bathe, swim and fish in -- is clean. The Republicans are destroying it and
overturning laws that slow global warming.

Those old enough to remember the '70s and '80s will recall smog, toxic land,
poisoned rivers. There are few such stories these days, thanks to the EPA. We've
made huge ecological progress since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire. Republicans
ideology insists that government environmental intervention is harmful, that it
kills jobs. In fact, these Republican actions will kill people. They're not
working for us. They're shills for corporate polluters.

The modern Republican Party has become a lethal enemy of the American people.
