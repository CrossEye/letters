I didn't respond to Bob Yenkner's suggestion that global warming letters were a
waste of time. He wants to see a reconciliation, but there is a problem. Ed
Smith responded, decrying his calling the issue "petty". Perhaps Mr. Smith was
too argumentative, but he demonstrates how many see this. Here's a little story:

  - "The building is one fire," they shouted.  "Quick, let's do something."

  - "Why are you so sure it's on fire?" came the reply.

  - "Flames, smoke, heat.  In short, evidence."

  - "This doesn't sound certain.  I've seen smoke before without fire."

  - "Look, the 97 of us upstairs saw it.  It's on fire, damn it!"

  - "Calm down.  Three people just went to the basement and found no fire."

  - "It's upstairs.  We need to fix this now!"

  - "Now don't be alarmist!  You'll cause panic."

  - "Don't you get it?  The building is burning!"

  - "According to you.  Our experts say otherwise."

  - "Your experts weren't upstairs.  We need to put it out!"

  - "One of your so-called witnesses once wrote a treatise on fire-proofing a house."

  - "So?"

  - "He clearly has a bias."

  - "Huh?"

  - "He can publish more articles if he finds buildings on fire. You must 
account for that."

  - "We all saw it.  The building will burn down if we don't hurry."

  - "No, you saw what the elites wanted you to see.  They're simply 
  manipulating your fear of fire to make you think there's a problem."

  - "What?!  Why would you think that?  For heaven's sake, there's a fire!"

 

  - A would-be conciliator steps in.  "Everyone calm down!  There are good points on both sides.  We need to stop arguing.  We'll never get anything done if we can't debate calmly."


That's how conciliation attempts sound in this context.
