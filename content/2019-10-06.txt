Responses to Dan Armstrong:

Science, he says, is not about creating models. He's wrong, of course. Firing a
rocket with this force at that angle, what will its trajectory be? That model is
the law of gravity. Adding this much CO2 to our atmosphere, how will our planet
react? That's a climate model.

He should review the SAT analogy section. I said that tides are to fluid
dynamics as climate is to weather. He confuses it, saying I compared fluid
dynamics to climate.

Regardless of how the denialist press spins it, the Mann-Ball lawsuit was
dismissed without ruling on the merits after an apology
(http://bit.ly/mann-ball) because of delays from Mann's team.

He explains the Kobe paper, adding little to my gloss: it correlates magnetic
shifts with previous warming trends but doesn't rebut the consensus that the
current warming trend is due to human activity.

He should research the Gambler's Fallacy. Something averaging every 450,000
years is not more likely to happen now because the last one was 780,000 years
ago. Numbers don't work that way.

He quotes Robert Laughlin and Judith Curry. Dr. Curry doesn't believe the
consensus is strong, but she doesn't challenge the actual facts of anthropegenic
global warming. Dr. Laughlin only talks about other periods of warming and how
warming doesn't threatens Earth's existence.

He claims academic qualifications for John T Reid, but again gives no
references. For Petr Ch√Ωlek, he describes what can easily be found on Google,
but doesn't tell where he read the paper he quoted. I've looked again and still
not found it. (An abstract does not count.)

He berates me for not respecting those scientists whose credentials I thought
irrelevant. If that's how he feels, how does he not respect the opinions of
those 97% of experts who do support the consensus?
