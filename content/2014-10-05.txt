Chuck Corso bemoans the state of education in American cities.  The
remainder of his recent letter bears this out.

His letter, which claims that progressives bash conservatives but
offer no solutions of their own, itself bashes progressives but offers
no solutions of its own.  He misuses a recent statistic in a way any
ten year-old could see through and complains that this statistic is
being censored by school officials.  (Sorry, Mr. Corso, the Science
Department isn't interested in your grainy Bigfoot photos either.)

Mr. Corso acts like a schoolyard bully, inventing insulting names in
the the hopes that others will pick them up.  Tellingly, one of these
insults uses the word "Distortion", which aptly describes his own
summary of Joe Stevens' recently published letters.

And of course, Mr. Corso uses his own peculiar misinterpretation of
Mr. Stevens' words to describe an entirely different person -- me --
as hypocritical.

Yes, Chuck Corso's writing is prima facie evidence that there's
something wrong with our educational system.  If I want to know how
conservatives think, I wouldn't ask Mr. Corso.  First, I'd need to
find one who actually can.
