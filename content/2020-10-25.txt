After the dueling presidential town halls, one Trump aide referred to Joe Biden
as Mr. Rogers. It was clearly meant as an insult. But America knows better. We
knew Fred Rogers; he invited us into his home. He projected kindness, warmth,
competence, wisdom, and above all, empathy... traits sorely lacking in the White
House for the past four years.

We have our own Mr. Rogers running for Connecticut's 55th Assembly District.
John Collins will invite you into his home (or these days come visit yours!) He
will treat you with dignity and respect and never talk down to you. He will
listen to your problems, probing kindly and gently until he discovers the root
of the issue and then find a way to fix it.

John Collins will serve our small towns with grace and dignity. He knows the
issues we face. He has experience solving real problems. One thing is for
certain: no one will ever need to ask him, "Won't you be my neighbor?" We
already know it. John Collins is our neighbor.
