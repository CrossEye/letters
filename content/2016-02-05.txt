Fifth and final in a series discussing what progressives actually believe. Last
time: corporate power.

Perhaps a fitting way to end this is to quote from one of the most famous
progressives in American history. Theodore Roosevelt helped shape the twentieth
century progressive movement, and his words from a century ago still ring true:

"I believe in pure democracy. With Lincoln, I hold that 'this country, with its
institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.. Whenever they shall grow
weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right
of amending it.'

"We Progressives believe that the people have the right, the power, and the duty
to protect themselves and their own welfare; that human rights are supreme over
all other rights; that wealth should be the servant, not the master, of the
people.

"We believe that unless representative government does absolutely represent the
people it is not representative government at all.

"We test the worth of any men and all measures by asking how they contribute to
the welfare of the men, women, and children of whom this nation is composed.

"We are engaged in one of the great battles of the age-long contest waged
against privilege on behalf of the common welfare."

Roosevelt's battle continues to this day, and it's progressives who are waging
it.
