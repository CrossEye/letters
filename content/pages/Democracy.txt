The United States is a Democracy and a Republic
===============================================

Writers to the Rivereast regularly repeat a false refrain.  They tell us that
"The U.S. is not a democracy; it is a republic."  This is entirely wrong.  In
fact, the U.S. is both a republic and a democracy."

We are a republic because we have no monarch.  We are a democracy because we
regularly elect out lawmakers.  It really is that simple.

The false dichotomy has been very prominent lately as conservatives want to
promote the status quo in opposition to popular will.  They'll cite founders who
were very nervous about democracy and the tyranny of the majority.  They are
right; founders such as Hamilton and Adams were skeptical.  But others such as
Paine and Jefferson were more enthusiastic. (Note that the party created by
Jefferson and Madison was initially known as the Democratic-Republicans.)

But much more important is the country we are now.  You might notice some
changes over the years, including enfranchisement of women, former slaves,
other people of color, and adults as young as 18.  We've started direct 
election of Senators, added presidential electors for the District of
Columbia, and banned the poll tax.  We've overturned Jim Crow restrictions.

Over the years, we've gradually come closer to Lincoln's description: "a
government of the people, by the peopls and for the people."
