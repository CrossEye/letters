 About this Site
 ===============

I am one of those gadflies who writes often to the local weekly paper. I've been
doing it for years.  This page is collecting those letters for posterity.  At
the moment, the letters from 2012 to the present are included, plus a scattering
of older ones.  I will add more as I find time (and, often, as I find the
letters themselves.)

Notes
-----

I'm a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions. That comes
through in those letters.  I have covered topics such as [Global Warming][gw],
the ideas of [Progressivism][pr], [Fact Checking][fc], the presidency of 
[Donald Trump][dt], as well as [many others][to].

I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please
remember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very
important, the local ones, the national ones, and the global ones. 

Although I have in the past served in the local government of Andover,
Connecticut (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning
Commission, the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town
Committee), all of the letters here represent my own views and not those of
these organizations.

These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,
not the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>.  The dates are the dates I
wrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A few were never
published, and I never did try to determine why.  There may have been mild
editing by the <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don't exactly match what was
published, but that's rare, and it never changes the meaning.

Feel free to [email me][em] with any comments or suggestions.

Details of how this is built are on the [technical page][tp].
