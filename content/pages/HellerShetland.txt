==================

Letters to the Rivereast promote [Tony Heller's website][rcs] as a counter to
the antrhopogenic global warming consensus. This site has [terrible
ratings][mbfc] on media analysts sites, and I've seen it to contain barely
researched climate articles mixed in with various right-wing content. Reading it
today, the first climate article was
https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/leaders-in-the-race-to-net-zero/.

I added a comment to its nonsense; I don't know if the modertor will approve.
It's included below.

For context, the article was incredibly brief, saying only

> On March 21, 2022 the Shetland Islands were *leaders in the race to net zero*.
> By April 2023, ninety-six percent of the population will be in fuel poverty.

and then linking to the following two articles, quoting the first two paragraphs
of each directly:

  - https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/03/02/the-remote-shetland-islands-are-a-surprising-leader-in-the-race-to-net-zero
  - https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/01/fuel-poverty-could-hit-anyone-earning-under-120k-on-these-remote-uk-islands?dicbo=v2-dfe8ddef87cb6d67c0e3327dfa8f0dba

My comment follows:

> Do you really expect people to see those two headlines and conclude that 
> moving toward net-zero is causing the Shetland’s fuel poverty? Do you believe
> your audience is really that stupid? Do they not read the linked articles? Do
> you?
> 
> Because if you did, you would learn from the first one that the Shetland 
> Islands are already — and have long been — among the most fuel-poor in 
> Britain, despite the long history of oil extraction in their region.
> 
> You would further learn that the wind farms in development for a decade and
> due to come online in 2024 are expected to radically change this situation,
> that the islands are investing in innovative hydrogen extraction technologies
> in part to use some of their excess energy because they will be generating
> more wind energy than they can use and more than the current infrastructure
> will allow them to export.
> 
> So the question is simple: do you actually believe the things you’re implying
> in the face of the very evidence you supply, or are you trying to manipulate
> what you see as a stupid audience into believing a lie?

The response from that site was similiarly brief:

> The problem was created by government focusing on unreliable green energy 
> while shutting down their reliable energy sources. Perhaps you should use
> less insults and instead try using your brain?

To which I replied:

> Neither article says anything remotely like that. It’s not that they’ve been
> shutting down anything, and the likely PM is talking about increasing nearby
> offshore drilling for oil and gas. But that’s not likely to help. In fact, “New
> oil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually
> sold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel
> the climate crisis.”
> 
> The problem is that the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
> has worsened the overall energy situation across Europe, and that it’s much
> worse in such a far-flung British region. Moreover the timing is terrible, since
> it’s only about eighteen months until the new cleaner, cheaper system comes
> online.
> 
> But there is no indication at all in either article or in the juxtaposition of
> them that the green energy investment had anything at all to do with the current
> crisis.
> 
> Your posting the two together to try to prove something is disingenuous at best.
> If you’ve actually read and understood both articles, then it’s far worse: it’s
> crassly manipulative.
> 
> Someone pointed to this site as one that had strong counterarguments to the
> global warming consensus. Although I’d seen it before and was turned off by the
> overtly political things that fill up the front page, I decided to give it
> another look. This is the first climate article I saw. If it’s any indication of
> the quality of this site, then it’s definitely not worth my time.

There has been no further response as of this writing, two weeks later.

Another gem is at https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/truth-and-community/,
which simply tries to make a point using a ridiculous logical fallacy.  You can 
read it or simply get the gist from my [comment][co1], which says:


> The linked article is titled “While the Climate Always Has and Always Will
> Change, There Is no Climate Crisis.”
> 
> A fact-checker partnered with Facebook said that this is false, and you take
> this to mean, “Facebook fact-checkers determined … earth’s climate didn’t used
> to change” ?!!!
> 
> You really do think your audience is extremely stupid, huh? Perhaps they are, I
> don’t know. Any bright five-year-old should see through this attempted
> misdirection.
> 
> To say that “While A is true, B is not” is false, is not to make any claim at
> all about A. The sentence is about B, and the subordinate clause is entirely
> irrelevant to the discussion.
> 
> They were clearly and obviously saying that “there is no climate crisis” is
> false. Anything else is sophism.
