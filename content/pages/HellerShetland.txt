==================

Letters to the Rivereast promote [Tony Heller's website][rcs] as a counter to
the antrhopogenic global warming consensus. This site has [terrible
ratings][mbfc] on media analysts sites, and I've seen it to contain barely
researched climate articles mixed in with various right-wing content. Reading it
today, the first climate article was
https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/leaders-in-the-race-to-net-zero/.

I added a comment to its nonsense; I don't know if the modertor will approve.
It's included below.

For context, the article was incredibly brief, saying only

> On March 21, 2022 the Shetland Islands were *leaders in the race to net zero*.
> By April 2023, ninety-six percent of the population will be in fuel poverty.

and then linking to the following two articles, quoting the first two paragraphs
of each directly:

  - https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/03/02/the-remote-shetland-islands-are-a-surprising-leader-in-the-race-to-net-zero
  - https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/01/fuel-poverty-could-hit-anyone-earning-under-120k-on-these-remote-uk-islands?dicbo=v2-dfe8ddef87cb6d67c0e3327dfa8f0dba

My comment follows:

> Do you really expect people to see those two headlines and conclude that 
> moving toward net-zero is causing the Shetland’s fuel poverty? Do you believe
> your audience is really that stupid? Do they not read the linked articles? Do
> you?
> 
> Because if you did, you would learn from the first one that the Shetland 
> Islands are already — and have long been — among the most fuel-poor in 
> Britain, despite the long history of oil extraction in their region.
> 
> You would further learn that the wind farms in development for a decade and
> due to come online in 2024 are expected to radically change this situation,
> that the islands are investing in innovative hydrogen extraction technologies
> in part to use some of their excess energy because they will be generating
> more wind energy than they can use and more than the current infrastructure
> will allow them to export.
> 
> So the question is simple: do you actually believe the things you’re implying
> in the face of the very evidence you supply, or are you trying to manipulate
> what you see as a stupid audience into believing a lie?
