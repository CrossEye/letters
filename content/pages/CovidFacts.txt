Many _RiverEast_ letters are spreading misinformation about Covid. After seeing
this over and over, I thought it time to collect some actual facts with clear
citations to sources. I am no expert, but I am scientifically literate, and know
how to perform basic online research.

I understand that those pushing these lies will accuse me of being a shill for
something: the government, the drug companies, the [mainstream media][mm], but
their conspiracy theories don't interest me.  We know how inept our government
can be; there is absolutely no way that it could ever sustain the wide-ranging
conspiracy they seem to imagine.  Instead, I contend, it's these folks listening
to the echo chambers of the same few sources, many with financial interests tied
to denying various truths.  (See also: global warming, tobacco, gun safety.)

While I may eventually try to add some structure to this, right now it's just a
simple list of the lies and their corrections.

Let's start with this:
