Covid Facts
===========

Many _RiverEast_ letters are spreading misinformation about Covid. After seeing
this over and over, I thought it time to collect some actual facts with clear
citations to sources. I am no expert, but I am scientifically literate, and know
how to perform basic online research.

I understand that those pushing these lies will accuse me of being a shill for
something: the government, the drug companies, the [mainstream media][mm], but
their conspiracy theories don't interest me.  We know how inept our government
can be; there is absolutely no way that it could ever sustain the wide-ranging
conspiracy they seem to imagine.  Instead, I contend, it's these folks listening
to the echo chambers of the same few sources, many with financial interests tied
to denying various truths.  (See also: global warming, tobacco, gun safety.)

While I may eventually try to add some structure to this, right now it's just a
simple list of the lies and their corrections.

### False Treatments ###

#### Claim ####

Writers are claiming that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for Covid:

> "If [Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin] had been rightfully approved as 
> effective treatments, thousands of lives could've been saved and the
> 'pandemic' would've been easily subdued."
>
> _Sam Prentice, 9/17/2021_

> "Ivermectin, by the way, won a Pulitzer<sup>1</sup> and has 
> long been used to treat humans as well as livestock.  It appears to be safe 
> with no drug interaction. In 20 randomized trials it showed significantly 
> large benefits in treating COVID-19."

#### Truth ####

Ivermectin is considered something of a wonder-drug... in the treatment of
parasites such as worms and mites.  Studies have been done, and some are
ongoing, on its potential effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which
causes Covid.  Some early clinical evidence offered hope that this might be a
useful therapy.  But the clinical trials have not bourne this out.  The dosages
that would be required to help -- even if the in-vitro minor effect is not
simply a chimera -- are far too high for the human body, with neurologic and
other significant side effects.

The best scientific overview seems to be by [Popp, Stegemann, _et. al._][ps].
Their conclusion is that 

> "[T]he reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin 
> for treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized
> controlled trials."

The developer and manufacturer of Ivermectin, Merck, has of course been looking
into this.  With their own vaccine research halted and no promising therapeutics
in their pipeline, they would love to have this medicine repurposed.  But [their
statement][me] says

> [O]ur analysis has identified:
>
>  - No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from
>  pre-clinical studies; 
>
>  - No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in
>  patients with COVID-19 disease, and; 
>  
>  - A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.


As usual, the [Wikipedia article][wi] is a good starting place to gather
additional information.


### Lethality ###

#### Claim ####

We've seen this one a few times now:

> The [Covid] virus is no more deadly than the yearly flu
>
> _Gary Gile, 9/17/2021_


#### Truth ####

Since March, 2020, more than one in every five hundred Americans has died from
Covid.  There have been over 675,000 deaths out of 42 million cases.  The case 
fatality rate in the US is around 1.6%.  The best source of such information is 
probably the Johns Hopkins [Coronavirus Resarch Center][jh].  The 
[Mortality Analysis][ma] page captures these statistics per country.


U.S. Flu deaths, by contrast, [average about][fd] 36,000 per year out of roughly
30 million cases each year, implying a case fatality rate of 0.12%.

The Lancet published an [interesting study][la] on the differences in outcomes
for hospitalized patients with Covid and the Flu, which, while not as drastic 
in details as the full numbers above, points out that

> Therefore, the number of observed deaths was considerably higher than what would
> be expected if the COVID-19 population had the same probability of dying as the
> influenza population.
