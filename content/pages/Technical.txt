Technical Details
=================

This site is an experiment.  I'm a computer programmer, and have over the years
sometimes specialized in building web applications, but for some time now I
have only built web sites / web applications to the specifications of others.

I was looking for a quick project to get my hands back in the entirety of web
development, when another Rivereast letter-writer pointed to his website which
included copies of his letters.  That sounded like the start of a good project
for me, since I have published many dozens of letters.  This has grown from 
that concept.


The Code
--------

The code is stored on [GitHub][gh] and served through [GitHub Pages][gp].  A
simple [GitHub Action][ga] rebuilds the static site.  There is no back end and
this is one step beyond a single-page app, as it's actually able to be served as
a single file, [letters.html][lh], although it's [usually viewed][ih] as a
standard HTML file with links to separate CSS and JS files.

The main content, the letters, are stored in the [content directory][lc] in files
formatted like this:

> <pre><code>
> Title: A Simple Description
> Date: 2020-10-19
> Topics: Donald Trump, [More Topics]
> People: [Comma-separated list of people mentioned]
> Content:
> --------------------------------------------------
> 
> Narcissist, con artist, tax evader, pathological 
> liar, cheat, bully, adulterer, fraud, egomaniac, 
> hate-monger, misogynist, xenophobe.
> 
> You don't need to know anything about me to know 
> who I'm describing.
> 
> So why in the world would you consider voting for 
> him?
> 
> --------------------------------------------------
> </code></pre>

This site is built by calling [build.js][bu], which parses those files (as well as
those in the [pages folder][pf]) turning them into `content.js` (and `pages.js`).
These are merged alongside the CSS, the main JS, and the themes into `index.html`,
creating that stand-alone `letters.html` file.


Application Design
------------------

Since this is mainly for myself, I was willing to make this a JS-only site.  If
it were to expand toward a more general static site generation tool (unlikely,
but possible), I would have to include some server-side generation, especially
if SEO was a real concern.  I'm simply happy not to have to do this at the
moment.

Although [`themes.js`][th] includes a little bit of code, at the moment, almost
the entire logic is contained in [`process.js`][pr]

With the exception of a few static pages, everything is generated on the fly by
the JS, based on the data stored in [`content.js`][co].



Web Design
----------

I am not a graphical designer.  Not even close.

I've tried to make an aestheically pleasing site, and offer multiple color
schemes for two reasons: one because my own tastes are probably not shared by
many, and two, because I wanted to play around with CSS variables, which I
haven't had the time to do recently.  The actual color schemes (except for
*Mellow Yellow*, which I made years ago) are shamelessly ripped off from sites
around the web.  I can't give credit as there aren't single sources for any of
them.  I'm pretty happy with the default theme, *I Feel the Earth Move*, and
somewhat satisfied with *Purple Haze*.  The others I have varying degrees of
frustration with.

The rest of the visual design: layout, typography, and so on, feels fairly 
natural to me, but as I said, I am not a graphical designer.

There is not much obvious interactivity here.  The only actions outside of
"page" navigation is search and theme switching.  Search still needs a bit of
work as it right now only finds exact matches.  I'm very happy with the theme
switching, though, and it gave me the chance to combine CSS variables with
dynamic SVGs.


Feedback
--------

I'd love to hear any feedback of a technical nature, suggestions for the code,
better UX or graphical designs, or anything else.  Feel free to [email me][ss]
or to raise a [new issue][is] or [pull request][pu].

Thank you to [Mike H][mh] for helpful feedback already given!
