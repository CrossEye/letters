A letter last week would have you believe that the Democrats voting for the
impeachment investigation were intensely partisan and unfair, but that somehow
the Republicans voting in lock-step against it even in the face of the
overwhelming evidence were not.

It's hard to even list all the lies. Here are a few truths, though: Republicans
were not kept out of any "secret depositions". The whistleblower was not
"planted". Donald Trump's denial of a quid pro quo has no more standing than
that of a mafia don protesting that "sleep with the fishes" was not an order to
murder. More than that, the writer asserts many things without evidence: How
does he know that Adam Schiff was leaking to the media? On what basis does he
claim that Mr. Schiff knew the whistleblower's identity? And what evidence does
he present that the testimony "consisted of nothing but lies and presumptions?"

Like so many who had presented themselves as conservatives, the writer has been
swept into the orbit of Donald Trump, and any claims to support our constitution
was swept away in the process.

Johnson's impeachment was warranted. Nixon's near-impeachment was clearly
warranted. Trump's behavior has been much worse than any of them. There are so
many reasons this want-to-be-autocrat does not deserve to lead our country. His
impeachment was not only warranted; it was essential. If the House did not
impeach him, it would have no institutional authority left to ever fulfill its
constitutional duties.
