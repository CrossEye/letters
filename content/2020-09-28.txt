John Collins is challenging incumbent Robin Green in the 55th district. Many of
us remember that Pam Sawyer admirably filled this seat for years. Robin Green
does not represent us as well.

Other letters described numerous votes she's cast out-of-sync with the values of
our small towns. I'll highlight just two. She voted against banning bump stocks.
After Sandy Hook, Connecticut knows the tragedy of gun violence. This sensible
bill prevents mass shooters from turning semi-automatic weapons fully automatic.
It passed without her, and the Justice Department soon took the same position.
But Ms. Green's NAY is a stain upon our district.

Second, she voted against a paid family and medical leave system in Connecticut.
It's hard to understand why. This vote certainly doesn't represent my values. I
imagine most residents feel the same.

John Collins is a humble, gentle man who has done a great job for Hebron. A man
of science, he will bring a strong environmental background to the legislature.
A man of quiet competence, he will bring ingenuity and experience to Hartford.
He will better represent Andover, Bolton, Hebron, and Marlborough.

There is one other reason I won't vote for Robin Green. This election, with the
mess the Republican party has made of our country, I will not vote for any
Republicans who don't publicly disavow the corrupt Donald Trump, not even for
dogcatcher. I have not heard such a renunciation from Ms. Green. I simply cannot
vote for her.

John Collins has my vote.
