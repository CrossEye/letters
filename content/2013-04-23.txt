I returned from vacation to two episodes of a rambling discourse on "Leading vs.
Dictating", and I have to respond.

Clearly the writer is a bit confused, arguing both that the Constitution is
sacred and unchanging and that our lawmakers have a duty to carry forward the
majority opinions of their constituents.

For the record, a substantial majority of Americans favored the gun law that
recently failed to pass the Senate. While I am part of that majority, I don't
think majority opinion is the right reason for it to be law. Our democracy is
not about majority rule. Our Founders could have chosen the Athenian model; I
believe they were wise not to. I think our system is better.

In our democracy, we choose representative based on what they believe, on what
they've done, on their integrity, and on how effective we expect them to be. We
should never elect them to parrot back our particular views.

While our elected representatives should listen to our views, true leaders do
not govern based on popular opinion. True leaders govern based upon what it
right.
