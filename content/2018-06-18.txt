Our so-called president has put some new twists on what it means to be an
American.

"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal..."

... except for Mexicans, except for Muslims, except for women, except for
disabled reporters, protesting athletes, war heroes, Democrats, FBI employees,
and anyone who dares oppose me.

"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
States of America..."

... and we should follow it closely unless it interferes with my divisiveness,
injustice, or war-mongering, unless it blocks my legal defense fund, unless it
reduces my personal wealth, unless it prevents me from locking up my enemies.

"... government of the people, by the people, for the people..."

... Hey, I'm a person, right?  So a government of Trump, by Trump, for Trump
still fits.

"... Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe
free / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. / Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tost to me, / I lift my lamp beside the golden door!..."

... and snatch their children from them, build a wall to keep them out, blame
them for non-existent crime-waves, sic ICE on them, and insult them at every
turn.

This is not normal.  Trumpism is a cancer on our body politic.  We must do
everything in our power to fight it.
