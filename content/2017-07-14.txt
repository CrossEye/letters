There are many ways to search for truth, but several stand out for their rigor,
objectivity, and transparency.  First, the scientific method: science seeks
truth by creating hypotheses and testing them with observation, measurement, and
experiment.  Second, our legal system: disputants present evidence before
impartial judges and juries, who weigh their competing claims.  Third,
journalism: reporters explain what is happening by cross-checking the claims of
one person with those of many others.

Such processes use evidence to determine truth.  It should be obvious that this
is necessary, but some people act as though evidence doesn't matter.

Too many of them are in positions of influence and power: entertainers
pretending to be journalists such as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Glenn
Beck, Congressional leaders such as Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, and, of
course, our so-called president.

Other ones fill these pages with lies that barely try to masquerade as truth.
Sam Prentice mixes irrelevant truths with very relevant falsehoods and ignores
the scientific evidence of global warming. Victor Carli goes further, inventing
quotations that misstate others' opinions, "correcting" truthful letters by
presenting easily checked lies, confusing disdain for an officeholder with
contempt for the office, and, in an extremely muddled bit of thinking, claiming
that acting as an "Unamerican Activist" is an attempt to resurrect McCarthyism.
(That would be very funny except that he actually seems to mean it.)

People like this devalue truth itself.  When they reject science by accepting
proclamations over repeatable experiments, when they reject justice by demeaning
the judges who serve it, when they reject journalism by treating hot-headed
loudmouths as superior to experienced professionals, they are demeaning all of
us.

When your ideology interferes with the search for truth, it is not the world
that is at fault.  It is your ideology.  It is you.
