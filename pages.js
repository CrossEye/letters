This page is collecting those letters for posterity.  At\nthe moment, the letters from 2012 to the present are included, plus a scattering\nof older ones.  I will add more as I find time (and, often, as I find the\nletters themselves.)</p>\n<!-- subtitute: currentLetter -->\n\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions. That comes\nthrough in those letters.  I have covered topics such as <a href=\"#/topic/Global+Warming\">Global Warming</a>,\nthe ideas of <a href=\"#/topic/Progressivism\">Progressivism</a>, <a href=\"#/topic/Fact+Checking\">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of\n<a href=\"#/topic/Donald+Trump\">Donald Trump</a>, as well as <a href=\"#/topics/\">many others</a>.</p>\n<p>I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please\nremember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very\nimportant, the local ones, the national ones, and the global ones.</p>\n<p>Although I have in the past served in the local government of Andover,\nConnecticut (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning\nCommission, the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town\nCommittee), all of the letters here represent my own views and not those of\nthese organizations.</p>\n<p>These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,\nnot the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>.  The dates are the dates I\nwrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A few were never\npublished, and I never did try to determine why.  There may have been mild\nediting by the <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don&#39;t exactly match what was\npublished, but that&#39;s rare, and it never changes the meaning.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:scott@sauyet.com\">email me</a> with any comments or suggestions.</p>\n"
