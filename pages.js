This page is collecting those letters for posterity.  At\nthe moment, the letters from 2007 to the present are included.  I will add more\nas I find time (and, often, as I find the letters themselves.)</p>\n<!-- subtitute: currentLetter -->\n\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions. That comes\nthrough in those letters.  I have covered topics such as <a href=\"#/topic/Global+Warming/\">Global Warming</a>,\nthe ideas of <a href=\"#/topic/Progressivism/\">Progressivism</a>, <a href=\"#/topic/Fact+Checking/\">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of\n<a href=\"#/topic/Donald+Trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, as well as <a href=\"#/topics/\">many others</a>.</p>\n<p>I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.  But please\nremember that I am serious, that I think the issues discussed are often very\nimportant, the local ones, the national ones, and the global ones.</p>\n<p>Although I have in the past served in the local government of Andover,\nConnecticut (on the Board of Education, the Capital Improvements and Planning\nCommission, the town Website Committee as well as the Democratic Town\nCommittee), all of the letters here represent my own views and not those of\nthese organizations.</p>\n<p>These are letters as submitted to the paper.  The titles are what I gave them,\nnot the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>.  For ealier letters, the\ndates are the dates I wrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A\nfew were never published, and I never did try to determine why.  There may have\nbeen mild editing by the <em>Rivereast</em> so that these don&#39;t exactly match\nwhat was published, but that&#39;s rare, and it never changes the meaning.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:scott@sauyet.com\">email me</a> with any comments or suggestions.</p>\n<p>Details of how this is built are on the <a href=\"#/pages/technical/\">technical page</a>.</p>\n"

    "Content": "<h1 id=\"covid-facts\">Covid Facts</h1>\n<p>Many <em>RiverEast</em> letters are spreading misinformation about Covid. After seeing\nthis over and over, I thought it time to collect some actual facts with clear\ncitations to sources. I am no expert, but I am scientifically literate, and know\nhow to perform basic online research.</p>\n<p>I understand that those pushing these lies will accuse me of being a shill for\nsomething: the government, the drug companies, the <a href=\"#/2021-03-19/\">mainstream media</a>, but\ntheir conspiracy theories don&#39;t interest me.  We know how inept our government\ncan be; there is absolutely no way that it could ever sustain the wide-ranging\nconspiracy they seem to imagine.  Instead, I contend, it&#39;s these folks listening\nto the echo chambers of the same few sources, many with financial interests tied\nto denying various truths.  (See also: global warming, tobacco, gun safety.)</p>\n<p>While I may eventually try to add some structure to this, right now it&#39;s just a\nsimple list of the lies and their corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"false-treatments\">False Treatments</h3>\n<h4 id=\"claim\">Claim</h4>\n<p>Writers are claiming that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for Covid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If [Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin] had been rightfully approved as\neffective treatments, thousands of lives could&#39;ve been saved and the\n&#39;pandemic&#39; would&#39;ve been easily subdued.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice/\">Sam Prentice</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Ivermectin, by the way, won a Pulitzer<sup>1</sup> and has\nlong been used to treat humans as well as livestock.  It appears to be safe\nwith no drug interaction. In 20 randomized trials it showed significantly\nlarge benefits in treating COVID-19.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Carol+Johnson/\">Carol Johnson</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup><strong>Note</strong>: presumably she&#39;s referring to the 2015 Nobel Prize\nin Physiology or Medicine for Ivermectin&#39;s creators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"truth\">Truth</h4>\n<p>Ivermectin is considered something of a wonder-drug... in the treatment of\nparasites such as worms and mites.  Studies have been done, and some are\nongoing, on its potential effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which\ncauses Covid.  Some early clinical evidence offered hope that this might be a\nuseful therapy.  But the clinical trials have not bourne this out.  The dosages\nthat would be required to help -- even if the in-vitro minor effect is not\nsimply a chimera -- are far too high for the human body, with neurologic and\nother significant side effects.</p>\n<p>The best scientific overview seems to be by <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015017.pub2/full\">Popp, Stegemann, <em>et. al.</em></a>.\nTheir conclusion is that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;[T]he reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin\nfor treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized\ncontrolled trials.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The developer and manufacturer of Ivermectin, Merck, has of course been looking\ninto this.  With their own vaccine research halted and no promising therapeutics\nin their pipeline, they would love to have this medicine repurposed.  But <a href=\"https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">their\nstatement</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[O]ur analysis has identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from\npre-clinical studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in\npatients with COVID-19 disease, and;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As usual, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_drug_repurposing_research#Ivermectin\">Wikipedia article</a> is a good starting place to gather\nadditional information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lethality\">Lethality</h3>\n<h4 id=\"claim-1\">Claim</h4>\n<p>We&#39;ve seen this one a few times now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The [Covid] virus is no more deadly than the yearly flu</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Gary+Gile/\">Gary Gile</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"truth-1\">Truth</h4>\n<p>Since March, 2020, more than one in every five hundred Americans has died from\nCovid.  There have been over 675,000 deaths out of 42 million cases.  The case\nfatality rate in the US is around 1.6%.  The best source of such information is\nprobably the Johns Hopkins <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\">Coronavirus Resarch Center</a>.  The\n<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">Mortality Analysis</a> page captures these statistics per country.</p>\n<p>U.S. Flu deaths, by contrast, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html\">average about</a> 36,000 per year out of roughly\n30 million cases each year, implying a case fatality rate of 0.12%.</p>\n<p>The Lancet published an <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2213-2600(20)30527-0/fulltext\">interesting study</a> on the differences in outcomes\nfor hospitalized patients with Covid and the Flu, which, while not as drastic\nin details as the full numbers above, points out that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the number of observed deaths was considerably higher than what would\nbe expected if the COVID-19 population had the same probability of dying as the\ninfluenza population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

I&#39;m a computer programmer, and have over the years\nsometimes specialized in building web applications, but for some time now I\nhave only built web sites / web applications to the specifications of others.</p>\n<p>I was looking for a quick project to get my hands back in the entirety of web\ndevelopment, when another Rivereast letter-writer pointed to his website which\nincluded copies of his letters.  That sounded like the start of a good project\nfor me, since I have published many dozens of letters.  This has grown from\nthat concept.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-code\">The Code</h2>\n<p>The code is stored on <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters\">GitHub</a> and served through <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>.  A\nsimple <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/blob/main/.github/workflows/rebuild.yml\">GitHub Action</a> rebuilds the static site.  There is no back end and\nthis is one step beyond a single-page app, as it&#39;s actually able to be served as\na single file, <a href=\"/letters.html\">letters.html</a>, although it&#39;s <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/blob/main/index.html\">usually viewed</a> as a\nstandard HTML file with links to separate CSS and JS files.</p>\n<p>The main content, the letters, are stored in the <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/tree/main/content/letters\">content directory</a> in files\nformatted like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>\nTitle: A Simple Description\nDate: 2020-10-19\nTopics: Donald Trump, [More Topics]\nPeople: [Comma-separated list of people mentioned]\nContent:\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNarcissist, con artist, tax evader, pathological\nliar, cheat, bully, adulterer, fraud, egomaniac,\nhate-monger, misogynist, xenophobe.\n\nYou don't need to know anything about me to know\nwho I'm describing.\n\nSo why in the world would you consider voting for\nhim?\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This site is built by calling <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/blob/main/build.js\">build.js</a>, which parses those files (as well as\nthose in the <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/tree/main/content/pages\">pages folder</a>) turning them into <code>content.js</code> (and <code>pages.js</code>).\nThese are merged alongside the CSS, the main JS, and the themes into <code>index.html</code>,\ncreating that stand-alone <code>letters.html</code> file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"application-design\">Application Design</h2>\n<p>Since this is mainly for myself, I was willing to make this a JS-only site.  If\nit were to expand toward a more general static site generation tool (unlikely,\nbut possible), I would have to include some server-side generation, especially\nif SEO was a real concern.  I&#39;m simply happy not to have to do this at the\nmoment.</p>\n<p>Although <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/blob/main/themes.js\"><code>themes.js</code></a> includes a little bit of code, at the moment, almost\nthe entire logic is contained in <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/blob/main/process.js\"><code>process.js</code></a></p>\n<p>With the exception of a few static pages, everything is generated on the fly by\nthe JS, based on the data stored in <a href=\"/content.js\"><code>content.js</code></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"web-design\">Web Design</h2>\n<p>I am not a graphical designer.  Not even close.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve tried to make an aestheically pleasing site, and offer multiple color\nschemes for two reasons: one because my own tastes are probably not shared by\nmany, and two, because I wanted to play around with CSS variables, which I\nhaven&#39;t had the time to do recently.  The actual color schemes (except for\n<em>Mellow Yellow</em>, which I made years ago) are shamelessly ripped off from sites\naround the web.  I can&#39;t give credit as there aren&#39;t single sources for any of\nthem.  I&#39;m pretty happy with the default theme, <em>I Feel the Earth Move</em>, and\nsomewhat satisfied with <em>Purple Haze</em>.  The others I have varying degrees of\nfrustration with.</p>\n<p>The rest of the visual design: layout, typography, and so on, feels fairly\nnatural to me, but as I said, I am not a graphical designer.</p>\n<p>There is not much obvious interactivity here.  The only actions outside of\n&quot;page&quot; navigation is search and theme switching.  Search still needs a bit of\nwork as it right now only finds exact matches.  I&#39;m very happy with the theme\nswitching, though, and it gave me the chance to combine CSS variables with\ndynamic SVGs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feedback\">Feedback</h2>\n<p>I&#39;d love to hear any feedback of a technical nature, suggestions for the code,\nbetter UX or graphical designs, or anything else.  Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:scott@sauyet.com\">email me</a>\nor to raise a <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/issues/new\">new issue</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/CrossEye/letters/issues/new\">pull request</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://github.com/buzzdecafe\">Mike H</a> for helpful feedback already given!</p>\n"
