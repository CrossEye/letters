This page is collecting those letters for posterity.  At\nthe moment, the letters from 2007 to the present are included.  I will add more\nas I find time (and, often, as I find the letters themselves.)</p>\n<!-- subtitute: currentLetter -->\n\n<h2 id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m a politically-involved, progressive citizen with strong opinions. That comes\nthrough in those letters.  I have covered topics such as <a href=\"#/topic/Global+Warming/\">Global Warming</a>,\nthe ideas of <a href=\"#/topic/Progressivism/\">Progressivism</a>, <a href=\"#/topic/Fact+Checking/\">Fact Checking</a>, the presidency of\n<a href=\"#/topic/Donald+Trump/\">Donald Trump</a>, as well as <a href=\"#/topics/\">many others</a>.</p>\n<p>I do try to include a modicum of humor in many of these letters.

The titles are what I gave them,\nnot the headers supplied by the <em>Rivereast</em>.  For ealier letters, the\ndates are the dates I wrote them, not the issue date in which they appeared.  A\nfew were never published, and I never did try to determine why.

    "Content": "<h1 id=\"covid-facts\">Covid Facts</h1>\n<p>Many <em>RiverEast</em> letters are spreading misinformation about Covid. After seeing\nthis over and over, I thought it time to collect some actual facts with clear\ncitations to sources. I am no expert, but I am scientifically literate, and know\nhow to perform basic online research.</p>\n<p>I understand that those pushing these lies will accuse me of being a shill for\nsomething: the government, the drug companies, the <a href=\"#/2021-03-19/\">mainstream media</a>, but\ntheir conspiracy theories don&#39;t interest me.  We know how inept our government\ncan be; there is absolutely no way that it could ever sustain the wide-ranging\nconspiracy they seem to imagine.  Instead, I contend, it&#39;s these folks listening\nto the echo chambers of the same few sources, many with financial interests tied\nto denying various truths.  (See also: global warming, tobacco, gun safety.)</p>\n<p>While I may eventually try to add some structure to this, right now it&#39;s just a\nsimple list of the lies and their corrections.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"false-treatments\">False Treatments</h3>\n<h4 id=\"claim\">Claim</h4>\n<p>Writers are claiming that Ivermectin is an effective treatment for Covid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;If [Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin] had been rightfully approved as\neffective treatments, thousands of lives could&#39;ve been saved and the\n&#39;pandemic&#39; would&#39;ve been easily subdued.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Sam+Prentice/\">Sam Prentice</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Ivermectin, by the way, won a Pulitzer<sup>1</sup> and has\nlong been used to treat humans as well as livestock.  It appears to be safe\nwith no drug interaction. In 20 randomized trials it showed significantly\nlarge benefits in treating COVID-19.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Carol+Johnson/\">Carol Johnson</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><sup>1</sup><strong>Note</strong>: presumably she&#39;s referring to the 2015 Nobel Prize\nin Physiology or Medicine for Ivermectin&#39;s creators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"truth\">Truth</h4>\n<p>Ivermectin is considered something of a wonder-drug... in the treatment of\nparasites such as worms and mites.  Studies have been done, and some are\nongoing, on its potential effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which\ncauses Covid.  Some early clinical evidence offered hope that this might be a\nuseful therapy.  But the clinical trials have not bourne this out.  The dosages\nthat would be required to help -- even if the in-vitro minor effect is not\nsimply a chimera -- are far too high for the human body, with neurologic and\nother significant side effects.</p>\n<p>The best scientific overview seems to be by <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015017.pub2/full\">Popp, Stegemann, <em>et. al.</em></a>.\nTheir conclusion is that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;[T]he reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin\nfor treatment or prevention of COVID‐19 outside of well‐designed randomized\ncontrolled trials.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The developer and manufacturer of Ivermectin, Merck, has of course been looking\ninto this.  With their own vaccine research halted and no promising therapeutics\nin their pipeline, they would love to have this medicine repurposed.  But <a href=\"https://www.merck.com/news/merck-statement-on-ivermectin-use-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\">their\nstatement</a> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[O]ur analysis has identified:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from\npre-clinical studies;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in\npatients with COVID-19 disease, and;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As usual, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_drug_repurposing_research#Ivermectin\">Wikipedia article</a> is a good starting place to gather\nadditional information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lethality\">Lethality</h3>\n<h4 id=\"claim-1\">Claim</h4>\n<p>We&#39;ve seen this one a few times now:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The [Covid] virus is no more deadly than the yearly flu</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"#/person/Gary+Gile/\">Gary Gile</a>, 9/17/2021</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"truth-1\">Truth</h4>\n<p>Since March, 2020, more than one in every five hundred Americans has died from\nCovid.  There have been over 675,000 deaths out of 42 million cases.  The case\nfatality rate in the US is around 1.6%.  The best source of such information is\nprobably the Johns Hopkins <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\">Coronavirus Resarch Center</a>.  The\n<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">Mortality Analysis</a> page captures these statistics per country.</p>\n<p>U.S. Flu deaths, by contrast, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html\">average about</a> 36,000 per year out of roughly\n30 million cases each year, implying a case fatality rate of 0.12%.</p>\n<p>The Lancet published an <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/article/S2213-2600(20)30527-0/fulltext\">interesting study</a> on the differences in outcomes\nfor hospitalized patients with Covid and the Flu, which, while not as drastic\nin details as the full numbers above, points out that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the number of observed deaths was considerably higher than what would\nbe expected if the COVID-19 population had the same probability of dying as the\ninfluenza population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"

They tell us that\n&quot;The U.S. is not a democracy; it is a republic.&quot;  This is entirely wrong.  In\nfact, the U.S. is both a republic and a democracy.</p>\n<p>We are a republic because we have no monarch.  We are a democracy because we\nregularly elect out lawmakers.  It really is that simple.</p>\n<p>The false dichotomy has been very prominent lately as conservatives want to\npromote the status quo in opposition to popular will.  They&#39;ll cite founders who\nwere very nervous about democracy and the tyranny of the majority.  They are\nright; founders such as Hamilton and Adams were skeptical.  But others such as\nPaine and Jefferson were more enthusiastic. (Note that the party created by\nJefferson and Madison was initially known as the Democratic-Republicans.)</p>\n<p>But much more important is the country we are now.  You might notice some\nchanges over the years, including enfranchisement of women, former slaves,\nother people of color, and adults as young as 18.  We&#39;ve started direct\nelection of Senators, added presidential electors for the District of\nColumbia, and banned the poll tax.

    "Content": "<h1 id=\"realclimatescience\">RealClimateScience</h1>\n<p>Letters to the Rivereast promote <a href=\"https://realclimatescience.com\">Tony Heller&#39;s website</a> as a counter to\nthe antrhopogenic global warming consensus. This site has <a href=\"https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/\">terrible\nratings</a> on media analysts sites, and I&#39;ve seen it to contain barely\nresearched climate articles mixed in with various right-wing content. Reading it\ntoday, the first climate article was\n<a href=\"https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/leaders-in-the-race-to-net-zero/\">https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/leaders-in-the-race-to-net-zero/</a>.</p>\n<p>I added a comment to its nonsense; I don&#39;t know if the modertor will approve.\nIt&#39;s included below.</p>\n<p>For context, the article was incredibly brief, saying only</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On March 21, 2022 the Shetland Islands were <em>leaders in the race to net zero</em>.\nBy April 2023, ninety-six percent of the population will be in fuel poverty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then linking to the following two articles, quoting the first two paragraphs\nof each directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/03/02/the-remote-shetland-islands-are-a-surprising-leader-in-the-race-to-net-zero\">https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/03/02/the-remote-shetland-islands-are-a-surprising-leader-in-the-race-to-net-zero</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/01/fuel-poverty-could-hit-anyone-earning-under-120k-on-these-remote-uk-islands?dicbo=v2-dfe8ddef87cb6d67c0e3327dfa8f0dba\">https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/09/01/fuel-poverty-could-hit-anyone-earning-under-120k-on-these-remote-uk-islands?dicbo=v2-dfe8ddef87cb6d67c0e3327dfa8f0dba</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My comment follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you really expect people to see those two headlines and conclude that\nmoving toward net-zero is causing the Shetland’s fuel poverty? Do you believe\nyour audience is really that stupid? Do they not read the linked articles? Do\nyou?</p>\n<p>Because if you did, you would learn from the first one that the Shetland\nIslands are already — and have long been — among the most fuel-poor in\nBritain, despite the long history of oil extraction in their region.</p>\n<p>You would further learn that the wind farms in development for a decade and\ndue to come online in 2024 are expected to radically change this situation,\nthat the islands are investing in innovative hydrogen extraction technologies\nin part to use some of their excess energy because they will be generating\nmore wind energy than they can use and more than the current infrastructure\nwill allow them to export.</p>\n<p>So the question is simple: do you actually believe the things you’re implying\nin the face of the very evidence you supply, or are you trying to manipulate\nwhat you see as a stupid audience into believing a lie?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The response from that site was similiarly brief:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem was created by government focusing on unreliable green energy\nwhile shutting down their reliable energy sources. Perhaps you should use\nless insults and instead try using your brain?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which I replied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Neither article says anything remotely like that. It’s not that they’ve been\nshutting down anything, and the likely PM is talking about increasing nearby\noffshore drilling for oil and gas. But that’s not likely to help. In fact, “New\noil and gas could take a quarter of a century to pump out, will be eventually\nsold at global prices, and have no real impact on energy bills yet still fuel\nthe climate crisis.”</p>\n<p>The problem is that the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\nhas worsened the overall energy situation across Europe, and that it’s much\nworse in such a far-flung British region. Moreover the timing is terrible, since\nit’s only about eighteen months until the new cleaner, cheaper system comes\nonline.</p>\n<p>But there is no indication at all in either article or in the juxtaposition of\nthem that the green energy investment had anything at all to do with the current\ncrisis.</p>\n<p>Your posting the two together to try to prove something is disingenuous at best.\nIf you’ve actually read and understood both articles, then it’s far worse: it’s\ncrassly manipulative.</p>\n<p>Someone pointed to this site as one that had strong counterarguments to the\nglobal warming consensus. Although I’d seen it before and was turned off by the\novertly political things that fill up the front page, I decided to give it\nanother look. This is the first climate article I saw. If it’s any indication of\nthe quality of this site, then it’s definitely not worth my time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There has been no further response as of this writing, two weeks later.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Another gem is at <a href=\"https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/truth-and-community/\">https://realclimatescience.com/2022/09/truth-and-community/</a>,\nwhich simply tries to make a point using a ridiculous logical fallacy.  You can\nread it or simply get the gist from my [comment][co1], which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The linked article is titled “While the Climate Always Has and Always Will\nChange, There Is no Climate Crisis.”</p>\n<p>A fact-checker partnered with Facebook said that this is false, and you take\nthis to mean, “Facebook fact-checkers determined … earth’s climate didn’t used\nto change” ?!!!</p>\n<p>You really do think your audience is extremely stupid, huh? Perhaps they are, I\ndon’t know. Any bright five-year-old should see through this attempted\nmisdirection.</p>\n<p>To say that “While A is true, B is not” is false, is not to make any claim at\nall about A. The sentence is about B, and the subordinate clause is entirely\nirrelevant to the discussion.</p>\n<p>They were clearly and obviously saying that “there is no climate crisis” is\nfalse. Anything else is sophism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"
