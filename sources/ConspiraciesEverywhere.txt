Ed Kozlowski tells us that, "Liberals might want to consider that what they're told isn't always true".  And he tells us that Biden avoided in-person campaign events not because of Covid guidelines but because of fear of gaffes.  And he tells us the Russian collusion story -- still gaining steam in the news -- is a hoax.  And he tells us that progressives are absurdly gullible.  And he tells us that Biden has a D.C. reputation for dim-wittedness.  He's right: we shouldn't believe everything we're told!

Paul Bureau imagines more conspiracies that we have words to debunk, but let's take two.

He wants us to believe Covid is no more dangerous than the flu, because of similar recovery rates.  This is nonsense.  In the U.S. there are about 28 million flu cases and 35,000 deaths per year.  So far for Covid, it's more like 34 million cases and 375,000 deaths per year.  If those numbers seem similar to you, I can recommend a good remedial math instructor.

He also wants us to believe that the "education industry" does not care about children.  If he's including teachers in that odd phrase, then he clearly has not met many teachers.  Not all of them, to be sure, but a vast majority are in the underappreciated field precisely because they do care about children.  He also mentions teachers' unions.  He's right; unions don't care about children.  Their mission is helping the teachers, not their students.  Of course happier, more contented teachers do better by their students.

And Colin McNamara picks up Don Denley's anti-Connecticut rant.  I'll tell you what, it's been a great place to grow up, raise a family, educate my children, own a business, and find fulfilling, well-paid work.  Perhaps he'd find Mississippi more to his liking.
