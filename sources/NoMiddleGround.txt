At the Andover Charter hearing, First Selectman Jeff Maguire said, "I actually take the fact that Don Denley, a far right Republican, and Scott Sauyet, a far left Democrat [...] believe that these issues are inaccurate... I feel that that is a win because that means that we're driving the bus right down the middle of the field."

Now, ignoring his odd desire to drive a bus through a field, that sounds sensible, right?  It's perhaps a little cowardly, but there's often a desire to find a middle-ground between two extremes.  What's wrong with that?

It's simple: there is no middle ground.  Don and Scott are saying the *exact same thing*!

While we forcefully disagree about many things, we completely agree that questions 6 – 11 substantially rearrange Andover's power structures, taking authority away from you and me and handing it to the BOS and Town Administrator.  With all due respect to the revision commission's hard work, the process was too rushed and the results show it.

Many ballot questions sound reasonable but are extremely misleading.  The text alters much more than the questions express.  It makes sense to move seven days, aligning the town budget vote with the RHAM one; why does this mean other processes move *thirty* days?  Why does it mean the Town Administrator gets first crack at the budgets, inluding the AES one?  Why does it mean the Board of Finance's authority gets watered down, adding the BOS to their hearing?  What language would the charter include if Question 10 passes but 7 and 8 do not?  Why would we want to strip voters' right to choose a Town Clerk and to decide on proposed ordinances?

There is no middle ground.  We both urge everyone to vote no on Questions 6 – 11.  (More info: http://charter.andoverct.info/2024.)
