Remember the *X For Dummies* book series, tutoring people with no relevant background?  Or *The Complete Idiot's Guide to X" series, for those who know even less than the dummies?  I propose a new series for the still more clueless: *X for MAGAs*.  Here's a snippet from *Debating for MAGAs*, in response to Don Denley's latest incoherency.

Lesson 1: We understand that whining about perceived slights make you *feel* bigger -- more Trump-like, I suppose. But seeing a conspiracy in the placement of your letters makes you *look* much smaller.  Rivereast archives are online; double-check before putting your foot in your mouth.  As recently as December 8th you'll find Ed Kozlowski and Frank Blume on page 7, Ed Smith and me on 32.

Lesson 2: When you say, "He said A and B, and he's completely wrong; here's the evidence against B," you need to double-check. "A" is that most people thought the economy was bad, but not for themselves.  "B" was that inflation has been lower under Biden.  The trouble is, I did say "A", and supplied evidence; you offer no dispute.  But I didn't say "B".  To play "Gotcha" with the facts, you must understand them.  We know it's difficult for MAGAs, but please try!

Lesson 3: Don't obsess over a fault in one while overlooking it in another.  Biden has long been known for verbal gaffes. They pale in comparison to Trump's.  Biden confused certain foreign leaders with their predecessors?  Trump can't keep his current competitors straight, confusing Haley and Pelosi, mixing up Biden, Obama, and Clinton.  Watching his confustion is painful.

Lesson 4: We know math is not MAGAs stong suit.  We sympathize; it must be challenging to have no clue.  But it's ridiculous to wonder how much a $1.4 billion program will affect the average taxpayer (maybe $5) which is a rounding error against the $2 trillion debt added by Trump's Tax Scam giveaway.

Also, coming soon: *Empathy for MAGAs*.
