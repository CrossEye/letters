Ed Kozlowski says, "Democrats are fearfully desperate to stop Donald Trump."  He's right.  While I would prefer "resolute", "adamant", or "steadfast", the majority -- including Democrats -- absolutely want to stop Donald Trump.  The reason is simple: we love our country.

Our democracy began in earnest with the 1789 adoption of the Constitution, expanding since in land, people, and democratic ideals.  Starting in 2017, a cult of personality stressed existing fractures in the foundations of our nation and created new ones.  Authoritarian Donald Trump convinced the gullible that he, a narcissistic scion of wealth and privilege, was a man of the people who could actually lead.

That "leadership" consisted of racism, sexism, bullying, and incessant lying.  Where relations between groups were frayed, he tore them apart.  Where they seemed solid, he drove in wedges.  He began the dismemberment of our nation.  Now he wants to finish the job.

Anyone who loves this country should be fighting this tooth and nail.

Mr. Kozlowski does not act like a patriot, uncritically repeating Trump's lies.  A few responses: Mueller found incontrovertible evidence of obstruction of justice; I've read the report: sitting president Trump was not indicted because of a long-standing Justice Department prohibition.  As with Watergate, the New York indictment is about an illegal cover-up.  Trump admitted to lascivious behavior; Hillary Clinton was never accused of it.  Hunter Biden is a private citizen; we need care no more about his behaviors than about those of Baron Trump, Sasha Obama, Ron Reagan, Jr. or Amy Carter.  And anyone who disagrees with helping our ally -- and major world food producer -- battle aggression from our long-time foe has neither compassion nor an understanding of geopolitics.

Those who love our country must ceaselessly battle these lies and the grandstanding politician who promulgates them!
