I met Kim Hawes when our children were in Andover Elementary together.  It took some time before I realized that this quiet woman was one of the backbones of our community.  Kim helps out whereever she can.  If you had a child playing basketball, you know Kim.  If you've interacted with the Community Emergency Response Team, you know Kim.  If you've gotten involved with the Commission on Aging, you know Kim.  If you've been to a wedding by a local Justice of the Peace, you may have met Kim.  And of course, if you've had dealings with the Fire Department, you know Kim.

As an EMT with the Andover Volunteer Fire Department, Kim has seen first hand the commitment and dedication of our volunteers. She would like to be part of the decision making process to ensure our firefighters and EMT's have the resources and training necessary to continue to protect and serve our community.

I met Mark Williams years ago, when he helped us out of a jam, and then another, and another.  I know him for a compassionate man, and an extremely competent one.  I have two fantastic memories of Mark.  One has him standing by himself, hat off, over the grave of a recently-buried animal.  He stood quietly by himself, praying for the pet of a family he didn't even know.

The other memory began when a local woman was having a bit of a breakdown and causing a ruckus bad enough that the police were called.  I was there as a friend of the family, trying to help, but those of us who knew her weren't able to get through.  Mark was there as part of the emergency response team.  It was him who was able to calm her down and get her to agree to the necessary ambulance ride.

Kim's commitment.  Mark's compassion.  The competence of both of them.  These qualities will make them excellent Fire Commissioners.  Please vote for Kim Hawes and Mark Williams for Andover's Fire Commission.
