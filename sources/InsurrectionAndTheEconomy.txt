Michael Chotkowski: "What has Trump done to be excluded from ballots?"

He incited an insurrection, ending the USA's 240-year unbroken streak of peaceful transitions of presidential power.  The 14th Amendment is clear: "No person shall [ ... ] hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, [ ... ], who, having previously taken an oath [ ... ] as an officer of the United States [ ... ] to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof."  There is no mention of conviction and few of the Confederate leaders excluded had been convicted.

Ken Hjulstrom: The economy was better under Trump.

Trump *lost* 2.67 million jobs, including 170,000 manufacturing ones.  Biden *gained* 14.3 million jobs, including 790,000 manufacturing ones.  Before crediting the Covid recovery, notice that employment under Biden is 4.89 million higher than Trump's pre-Covid maximum, including 160,000 more manufacturing jobs: under Biden, we've passed an Infrastructure bill, the CHIPS act, and a green manufacturing bill.  Remember hat every week going to be Trump's Infrastructure Week?  Under Biden, it actually happened.

The right is whining about the debt, which grew at 8.9% per year under Trump, but at 8.3% per year under Biden.  They crow about energy independence but net oil imports have been falling steadily since 2006 and are much lower than during the Trump years.  We've averaged a net *export* of 877,000 barrels per month under Biden (for better or for worse, when it comes to the environment.)  Per-capita GDP rose at 1.5% per year under Trump and at an astounding 10.0% under Biden.

I'll take the current economy, thank you.  And I'll definitely take a President who believes in our democracy.  Sorry, Mr. Trump.
