Paul Bureau has appointed himself the arbiter of true Republicanism.  He's decided the overwhelming majority of the House Republican caucus is Republican In Name Only (RINO).  Who does he consider true Republicans?  Twenty of the least serious clowns ever to hold public office: legislative bomb-throwers, Trump lickspittles, science deniers, election buffoons, attention-mongers, and wannabe demagogues.  I don't know who Mr. Bureau thinks died and made him Hermann GÃ¶ring, but claiming the moron brigade is the best the party can offer is about the most absurd thing I've heard a conservative say on these pages... and that's saying a lot!

The modern Republican party is a shell.  It's been hollowed out by the Gingrich years, the Tea Party foolishness, and the Trump ascendancy.  What started as the party of the disenfranchised and the working Joe, the party of Lincoln and of Teddy Roosevelt, moved on to be the party of big business and the moneyed interests.  In the last few decades it's become the party through which cynical billionaires like the Mercers, Adelsons, and Kochs, manipulate the gullible into enriching them -- at the expense of their own pocketbooks and their own souls.

Even so, even in the morass that is the modern Republican party, Mr. Bureau's heroes have distinguished themselves as the most vituperative, most puerile, most dishonest collection of pols in our history.

Paul Bureau hasn't said what he stands for, although we can make some pretty good guesses.  Anyone who associates the Democratic party with communism and promotes the likes of Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert probably can't articulate a position of his own, only crying foul against the more compassionate and intelligent world he sees stacked against him.

(Apologies to Alison Walck: I couldn't fit "surge" in here.  I'll try harder next time.)
