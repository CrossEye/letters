It's no secret that the Republican party is a mess.  This is clear in many grand important issues of our time, but also obvious in the small details.

Let's start small.  Outside Andover's recent election, the Republicans hung a banner in their meet-and-greet tent.  It had traditional Republican logos and slogans, but it also quoted Thomas Jefferson: "A government big enough to give you everything you want, is big enough to take away everything you have."  Sure, a traditional small-government slogan, possibly aligned with what the party stood for, once upon a time.

Except, Thomas Jefferson never said that.

It's very easy to check these things.  I pasted the first ten words of the quote into two common search engines, and the first few hits on each -- including ones from the definitive Jefferson source, https://www.monticello.org/ -- make it clear that Jefferson never wrote this, 

It's a small thing, to be sure.  But this is a reusable banner presumably meant to hang at many events.  You'd think they'd take care before falsely attributing their propaganda to one of our country's Founders.

If Republican problem were limited to such minor peccadillos, it would be fine.  But it's in the bigger issues as well.  The House Republicans recently voted to send military aid to Israel.  To offset the cost, they want to cut funding to the IRS.

We don't need to consider the Israeli-Palestinian situation to see how ridiculous this is.  First of all, the Congressional Budget Office's report says that this would *increase* the deficit by over 80 billion dollars, because without enforcement, tax cheats simply get away with it.  It will benefit Republicans' rich donors and no one else.

Think of the moral implications.  The Republican party says, "Yes, we'll help out one of our closest allies in the world, but only if you let us make a political point that will worsen our debt and help the rich tax cheats."

What a disaster!
