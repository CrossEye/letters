It is time to fight back.

The chaos emanating from Washington is causing havoc in our small towns.  Connecticut officials are leading the charge to restore sanity.  The Marlborough and Andover Democrats have teamed up to bring together state leaders who will describe how these issues are affecting us all, what our officials are doing to counter the problems, and how residents can pitch in.  We are holding a Defending Democracy Forum on Sunday, April 27, from 3 -- 5 PM at Marlborough Elementary School.

This event features Lieutenant Governor Susan Bysiewicz and State Senators Cathy Osten and MD Rahman.  Come meet neighbors from Andover, Bolton, Columbia, Hebron, and Marlborough looking to solve these problems.   More information is at https://defending.ahmdems.org/.

Most residents -- regardless of who they voted for -- want the same things: honest leadership, respect for the rule of law, a fair shot for working families, and a future we can believe in. We may not always agree on how to get there, but we all deserve a government that listens, works, and acts with integrity.

We *can* bring this about.  This is America and the government belongs to us.

Come join us April 27.  Stand together for a stronger, fairer future!
