Secretary Clinton showed poor judgment with her private email server.  Remember the MAGA outcry?  "Lock her up!"  Donald Trump led the charge.

When the FBI investigated Russia's election interference, what did Trump do?  He fired the director of the FBI.  ("Lock her up!")  When special counsel Robert Mueller completed his report, what did Attorney General Barr do?  He released a summary radically misrepresenting the report.  ("Lock her up!")  Speaking of the Mueller report, Ed Kozlowski claims I'm obsessed with it.  I've written a total of three sentences about it over the last four years. (http://letters.sauyet.com/#/search/mueller.)  Hardly an obsession.

When the actual Mueller report demonstrated Barr's lies, showing that Russia interfered in the election, that Trump and his team welcomed it and shared information with Russia, that they obstructed justice to cover it up, what did Trump do?  He tasked John Dunham to investigate the investigation. ("Lock her up!")

When Dunham released his report, suggesting only that a preliminary investigation would have been more appropriate than a full one, what did the Republicans do?  They screamed he'd been co-opted by a deep state conspiracy.  ("Lock her up!")

When Trump realized that Joe Biden would be his 2020 opponent, what did he do?  He illegally pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden.  ("Lock her up!")  When Republicans gained control of the House, what did they do?  They sought evidence of wrong-doing by Biden's son.  ("Lock her up!")  When all they found were two misdemeanors, they again claimed some deep state nonsense.  ("Lock her up!")

Now, when Donald Trump was credibly indicted for stealing classified documents, refusing to return them, and shuffling them around insecure locations, what did the MAGAs do?  They screamed about the weaponization of the justice system.

The hypocrisy is astounding.
