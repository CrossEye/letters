People ask me why I bother responding to Sam Prentice.  "After all, he's just another loony, right?  He's just a conspiracy theorist whose theories aren't even coherent, never mind credible, isn't he?"  Well, perhaps.

But unlike some of his peers (and we won't mention prople like Colin Mcnamara, Frank Blume, or Ed Kozlowski by name, ok?) whose nonesense at the very worst might convine us to vote for the wrong politician or party, Mr. Prentice's rants are downright dangerous.  If the nonsense he peddles holds sway among our policy leaders, we could futher delay or even reverse progress in reducing the climate crisis.  And there's a real chance of that, since the entire Republican party elected to Washington has bought into it.

So why respond?  Well, truth should never be silent when falsehood is shouting.

But sometimes it's hard to bother.  His most recent diatribe -- about how CO2 is so beneficial we should embrace its increase -- is farcical.  He points back fifty million years as though it were a target to aim for, back when the Arctic Circle was a swamp, and sea levels were 250 feet higher.  That's his Eden?

So why respond?  Well, the arrogance is awful hard to stand.  He brazenly calls everyone who disagrees with him -- including the military, insurance companies, coastal states such as Florida and Texas, and the overwhelming majority of the scientific establishment -- uneducated buffoons.

But notice also his sleight of hand here.  A decade ago, he was arguing that the Earth was not warming.  Five years later, he claimed that it was, but that human-released C02 was not responsible for it.  Now he just wants to say that it will be beneficial to us.  This is a decision looking for justification after justification, and flailing as each one is undermined.

So why respond?  Well, I have a brand-new grandson.  I want his generation to inherit from us a garden.  Not a wasteland.
