Once again, the absurdity is amazing.  Misquoting Biden and quoting him out of context (see the usual fact-checkers), Sam Prentice goes on to assert all sorts of nonsense about election fraud.  He does this without evidence and it's obvious why: because there is none.  What these conspiracy theories postulate is that there is a grand cabal out to deny Trump a second term, including Republican and Democratic governors, legislators, and election officials, postal workers, voting machine makers, polling workers, poll watchers, and, I'm guessing, Santa's elves.  But I'll let you in on a little secret.  There is an actual large group trying to oust Trump: the American people.  Sorry about that.

It's not just that we're shown no evidence.  The Trump campaign has tried litigating these claims in court, over and over.  His results so far: 1 win, 46 losses.  Someone call the Guiness Book.  Has any plaintiff ever had such a record of losses in a single month?

Speaking of one month, in 2016 Trump and some of his fans on these pages credited Trump for the post-election stock market bump.  It was impressive, a jump of 7.01% in one month.  I'm wondering, are those same people are willing to credit Biden for the rise of 9.03% since the 2020 election?

Anyway, unless they want to provide evidence, folks peddling huge election fraud are simply conspiracy theorists.  As I heard recently, "Don't laugh at kids for believing in Santa Clause.  Some adults still believe Trump won the election."
