Michael Chotkowski's recent letter might have made it all the way to amusing had it not been so muddled.  First, thanks for the election congratulations -- it's hard to lose when running unopposed, though.  That he wouldn't have voted for me does not wound me deeply, I'm afraid.  I will still do my best for all the children, including any he might have.

When I point out the Andover Republican's misattributed quote, his response boils down to, "Well, it *sounds* like Jefferson."  Then he goes on to lecture us about proper quotation!

He critiques my vocabulary, saying "peccadilloes" is too long a word.  I really don't feel it's all that uncommon.  But be careful, or I'll start using sesquipedalian ones!

Finally -- and I wouldn't have bothered responding except for this inspired piece of nonsense -- he uses the editor's placement of Frank Blume's "Debts and Budgets" letter next to my own as somehow proof that I don't care about a number of issues -- that I am focused exclusively on one issue.  Huh?  What?  I happen to have seventeen years of letters online; a list of the 200 topics discussed is at http://letters.sauyet.com/#/topics/.

I am focused on different issues than Mr. Chotkowski.  He mentions a few concerns.  Inflation: it's now at 3.2%, lower than during the Reagan years and below wage growth.  A border-crisis: if we don't want a Japan-style economy, we probably should be *increasing* immigration.  Crime: violent crime rates have been falling for more than 30 years.  Drugs: agreed, there's a problem; can we go after the two most deadly ones first?  If we can't reduce the harm from tobacco and alcohol, what hope do we have for fentanyl or heroin? 

I can't sign off without pointing out that he accuses me of not being conservative.  Well, duh!
