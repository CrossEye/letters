Sam Pretice gets it wrong again.  Yes, some of the founders (notably Adams and Hamilton) were suspicious of democracy.  Others (Jefferson, Paine, Washington) were more sympathetic.  But within a generation, we were regularly described as a democracy.  There are great quotes about our democracy from Jackson, Lincoln, both Roosevelts, Reagan, and many other leaders.

The 14th, 15th, 17th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th amendments to the constitution and, arguably, a few others expanded the democratic nature of our government.  Yes, we have checks and balances to impede bread and circus thinking, but over the years we've grown more accustomed to "a government of the people, by the people and for the people."

The recent mantra we've been hearing about us not being a democracy has mostly been provided to defend some of the remaining anti-democratic provisions of our government, state's equal weighting in the Senate and the Electoral College.  This is power trying to hold onto power, nothing more.

Mr. Prentice cites the Federalist Papers in defense of the Electoral College.  (Odd, isn't it, how small-government conservatives love to promote the Federalist Papers whose whole purpose was to argue for a more powerful, more centralized government?)  I wonder if he has actually read the relevant one, #68, which describes a collection of deliberative bodies, nothing resembling the modern Electoral College.  2016 displayed the total failure of Hamilton's predictions.

We are a democracy.  We'd be a better one by eliminating the Electoral College.
