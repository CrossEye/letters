Bonnie Olivieri tells us we're uninformed because we disagree with her, that we're ignorantly voting in ways that will extend our most pressing problems.  That's not how it works.  Her notion of the most important problems are very different from mine.  I'm guessing I would vehemently disagree with her choices as the ballot box, but I will do her the courtesy of not implying that she's stupid for them.  I wish she would do the same for others.

She thinks our most important problems have to do with:

* Inflation -- mostly out of politician's control, having to do with overheated economies and oil shocks, but coming down now after it spiked when the economy improved so rapidly in 2021 and 2022.

* Immigration -- with the ongoing labor shortage and related rapid wage growth, if Ms. Olivieri would like lower inflation, she should be happy for a larger supply of cheap labor.  And very little fentanyl or sex trafficking is tied to illegal immigrants.

* CRT in schools -- pure nonsense, as this is taught in law schools, not primary and secondary schools.  And it's so obviously correct, it actually should be taught more widely.

* Rampant crime -- Even the spike in crime that started in 2019 is barely a blip on long-term charts of falling crime waves going back at least to the Clinton years.


I'd suggest that our most pressing actual problems are far worse than any of these:

* The ongoing climate crisis making our world a much less hospitable place to live.

* The devolution of a major American political party into anarchy and authoritarianism.

Voting in the opposition would have simply exacerbated these much more dangerous problems.

I agree that people could be helped by looking to better news media.  I don't know the television news vey well, but I would still suggest turning off the TV entirely.  I find these sources much more helpful: The New York Times, The National Review, The Washington Post, the Christian Science Monitor, The Atlantic, NPR, The New Yorker, The Hartford Courant, The Jouranl Inquirer.



Briefly, to Ed Kozlowski: It's endearing that you think my "report cards" implied I was acting like a college professor.  I was thinking Grade School, myself.
