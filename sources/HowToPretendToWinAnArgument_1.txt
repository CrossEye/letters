When Sam Prentice says, "We're not a democracy" and I respond with arguments concluding that we are in fact a democracy, what was his reponse?  He says that I am "disputing that we are a republic".  This is not even sophism; it's plain dishonesty.

A republic is a government designed to benefit the people rather than to benefit a leader such as a hereditary monarch.  That's all it means.  Most countries these days are republics.
