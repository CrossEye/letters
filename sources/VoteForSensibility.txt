To the Editor:

This election, Andover has a chance to restore some quiet sensibility to the Board of Selectmen: we can elect Anne Crem√©.  Anne is quiet and reserved, which can sometimes mask her steely core.  But it's there.  Anne is a woman of strong values, someone who will listen carefully to all sides before making a decision.  You have probably noticed the lack of decorum and the increase in conflict on the BOS.  Anne's presence will bring some much-needed balance.

Andover needs Anne!  Please vote for her.

Sincerely,

Julia Haverl
Andover
