Briefly: I need to thank Ed Kozlowski for providing additional ammunition (!) for the argument in favor of strong gun control laws.  Yes, the high gun murder rate in cities like Chicago, as well as in gun-toting states like Louisiana and South Carolina, do help demonstrate the need for stronger gun regulation.  Thank you for bringing it up.

Main topic: We all know the biggest problem facing our world.  Global warming, of course.  But there is another huge threat facing our country: the Republican Party.

I never used to be particularly partisan.  I was liberal and proud of it, but party politics simply did not interest me.  However the slide of the Republican Party into fury, nihilism, and grievance has made it the most clear and present danger to the American experiment at least since the Civil War, and perhaps ever.

It's blatherskites like Tucker Carlson, venal demagogues like Donald Trump, crass power-hungry connivers like Mitch McConnell, unqualified lifetime appointees like Brett Kavanaugh, incompetent buffoons masquerading as leaders like Marjorie Taylor Greene... but it's more than that.  It's also the idiots who can't face the truth that Donald Trump lost the election, the morons who think they're "owning the libs" by advancing the interests of billionaires like Koch, Mercer, and Adelson, the imbeciles who think they're "doing their own research" by choosing Fox over actual news sources.

The party that can pronounce Jan 6 to be "legitimate political discourse" is a party that no longer has any right to participate in our public dialogue.

I would love to revisit the point where the Right and the Left could debate their competing philosophies.  But the Right lost its chief champion when the Republican party descended into insanity.  I don't hold out much hope for its recovery.
