Why should we support Amanda V?  Simple: she's hard-working, knowledgeable, compassionate, extremely organized, faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound... or am I mixing up my heroes?

Amanda is out there knocking on doors; if she hasn't hit yours, you can bet she's talked to a neighbor.  She does this so she can get to know the community better, and the community can get to know her.  That might be redundant.  If you know any involved, caring, active member of your community, you understand who Amanda is.  If you're a hard-working, upstanding citizen, Amanda understands who you are.

Amanda has a great backstory.  A lifelong Republican, chair of her party, she became disillusioned with the direction of Republicans.  When her son asked how she could support the party that wanted to marginalize and oppress a friend of his, she realized she was done, and quit the party.  To make sure that no one could ever be demoralized by such Republican bullying, she ran for office.

Steve Weir is different.  His supporters only find two things good to say: he's a nice guy and he never missed a vote.  Being a nice guy is great.  Amanda is awfully nice too, though.  Not missing a vote is fine, but hardly a major virtue.

Steve is a champion of businesses.  Amanda is a champion of the people.  Steve is a proud member of the Conservative Caucus.  Amanda supports mainstream positions: socially liberal, fiscally conservative.  Steve's idea of getting to know the community is to fly around in his personal helicopter looking down at everyone.  Amanda will knock on your door and sit down at your kitchen table.

I want a queen bee, not a drone.  I'm proudly voting for Amanda V for the 55th!
