So what have we learned on these pages in the past few weeks?  Let's take a look.

We learned that Frank Blume believes stronger gun laws won't lower the violence but that quicker capital punishment will.  This in spite of overwhelming evidence that the reverse is true.  Let's hope neither he nor any of his loved ones are ever wrongly convicted!

We learned that Don Denley thinks Richard Nixon was a good president bullied by Lowell Weicker and Woodward and Bernstein.  Does this surprise anyone?

We learned that Sam Prentice will only respect that tiny minority of scientists who happen to believe what he does.  I suppose this shouldn't shock us, as he also explains how he does research: ignoring all the top results on Google, scrolling through page after page until he finds an obscure article that matches his theory.

And I can't say we learned anything new from it, but we were subject to his absurd conspiracy theories of the government pushing global warming in order to control our lives.  He did explain that the rapidly growing green energy sector was a "farce".  No word yet on why he believes these successful programs aren't working.  Dare we hope that one day Mr. Prentice will learn that "global" encompasses more than his immediate neighborhood?

We learned that David Anderson has watched far too many right-wing hit jobs on Hunter Biden.

We learned that Colin McNamara doesn't understand that Fitch's downgraded our credit because of Republicans playing politics with the debt limit.

We learned that Ed Kozlowski still has nothing to say.

On the lighter side, we've learned that Tim Rinnel might give Charlie Daniels a run for his money: "And if (Trump) wins, the devil gets your soul!"  Very nice!
