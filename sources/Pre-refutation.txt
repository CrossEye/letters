Have you ever seen so much pre-refutation as in Ed Kozlowski's recent letter? I told you he's a funny guy. If you want to refute any of his points in last week's letter, please see mine the week before â€“ you know, the one he was responding to? But it's unsporting to joust with the court jester. I will drop the subject and let him have the last word, should he want to embarrass himself again... but only after pointing out one final bit of ridiculousness: 

I quote: "In 2019, 16 foot, pressure treated 2x12 boards were $32. In 2020 they were $84. Now, $45". Does Mr. Kozlowski realize that Trump, not Biden, was in office throughout 2020? He's saying that they rose 163% during one year of Trump's term and have fallen 46% since, mostly under Biden. And he counts that as a strike *against* Biden?
