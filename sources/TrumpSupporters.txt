Trump supporters are an amazing bunch.  Whatever they think of Joe Biden, another Trump term is an overwhelming threat to our country.  Supporting this would-be tyrant demonstrates unpatriotic disloyalty to our great nation.

They scream about the economy.  But by every measure -- except inflation, which affected all our peer nations, and is now under control -- it's been better under Biden.  Trump has been publicly rooting *against* our economy.  He is perfectly happy to inflict misery on everyone to win votes.  Supporting Trump is supporting anti-American political extortion.

(A note to Don Denley: yes, people say the economy is bad; they also say their own finances are fine.  The disconnect demonstrates the gullible believing right-wing media's incessant lies; that doesn't make it true.) 

They follow Trump's lead and talk about crime rates.  Outside a little blip that started with the pandemic, they've been falling for decades, and 2023 had the sharpest drop in murder rate on record.  But the facts won't stop their screaming.  Supporting Trump is supporting unjustified paranoia.

Then they focus on immigration.  When the Democrats gave the Republicans everything they wanted in an immigration bill, Congressional Trump supporters nixed the bill because it might help Biden politically.  This is not speculation; they said it out loud.  They claim Biden can do it all via executive orders.  Remember when Obama set immigration rules through executive orders?  They went through the roof.  But they were silent when Trump did so.  Supporting Trump is supporting crass manipulation.

Now Trump says he'd let Putin invade certain NATO allies.  Those supporters will claim justification, as evident in Ken Hjulstrom's notion that Trump is a horrible human being but that's what we need right now.  Supporting Trump is supporting cowardly bullying.

In fact, supporting Trump is supporting evil, plain and simple.
