It's impossible to count the number of good reasons to vote for Andover's Democratic slate.  The competence, the experience, the compassion of the candidates speaks volumes.  Note the long town involvement of people like Kim Hawes for Fire Commission and Emily Timreck and Linda Armstrong for BAA.  Note the compassionate but quiet determination of Anne Crem√©.  Note the fierce educatinal advocacy of Shanon Louden and Caitlin Madintosh Greenhouse.  Oh yes, and note the sheer number of women running on the Democratic ticket!

In 2023, there are also uncountably many reasons to vote against Republicans.

When the country elects Republicans, we get a disaster like the current House caucus, which cannot accomplish anything other than backstabbing and infighting.  (Remember when the Democrats last had control?  With a similarly thin majority, they passed significant legislation with absolutely no spectacle.)  Or we get a so-called president whose continual lies incited an insurrection, and who, despite numerous serious indictments looks nearly certain to win another nomination.

When states elect Repuclicans, we get Florida banning books, excising discussion of slavery, Jim Crow, and George Floyd, and waging war with its largest private employer and biggest tourist attraction simply because they had the temerity to speak out for their gay employees.

When Connecticut towns elect Republicans, we get the clown show in Colchester described every week on these pages, with a mini-despot banning books, single-handedly conducting a sham investigation into an employee for political reason, tearing up agendas, screaming at voters, and who knows what else?   Or in Andover we have a Republican Town Committee, knowing that a man was recently arrested for domestic assault, still chose to nominate him for local office.

So again, Andover has numerous great reasons to vote for Democrats, and numerous great reasons to vote against Republicans.  It's an easy call to make.
