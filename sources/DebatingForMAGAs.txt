Remember the *For Dummies* books, tutoring those without relevant background?  Or *The Complete Idiot's Guide* series, for those understanding even less than the dummies?  I propose a new series for the still more clueless: *For MAGAs*.  Here's a snippet from *Debating for MAGAs*, in response to Don Denley's latest incoherency.

Lesson 1: We understand that whining about perceived slights makes you *feel* bigger -- more Trump-like, I suppose. But claiming conspiracy in the placement of your letters makes you *look* much smaller.  Rivereast archives are online; double-check before putting your foot in your mouth.  As recently as December 8th you'll find Ed Kozlowski and Frank Blume on page 7, Ed Smith and me on 32.

Lesson 2: Before saying, "He said A and B, and he's completely wrong; here's the evidence against B," please double-check. "A": Most people thought the economy was bad, but not for themselves.  "B": Inflation has been lower under Biden.  The trouble is, I said "A", and supplied evidence; you offer no dispute.  But I didn't say "B". Go ahead and reread.  To play "Gotcha", you must understand the facts.  We know it's difficult for MAGAs, but please try!

Lesson 3: Don't obsess over a fault in one while overlooking it in another.  Biden has long been known for verbal gaffes. They pale in comparison to Trump's.  Biden confused certain foreign leaders?  Trump can't keep his current competitors straight, confusing Haley and Pelosi, mixing up Biden, Obama, and Clinton.  Watching his befuddlement is excruciating.

Lesson 4: We know math isn't MAGAs' strong suit.  We sympathize; it's challenging to have no clue.  But it's ridiculous to discuss how a $1.4 billion program will affect taxpayers (maybe $5), a mere rounding error against the $2 trillion debt from Trump's Tax Scam giveaway.

Also, coming soon: *Empathy for MAGAs*.
