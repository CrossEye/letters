Fact-checking is straightforward.  When something makes your blood boil, test whether it passes muster.  Check your sources with https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/, which describes media sources, their biases, and their accuracy.  An outlet like like https://www.oann.com/ (questionable source, factual: low) can be safely ignored.  One like https://www.washingtonpost.com/ (left-center bias, factual: high), can be counted on for the facts, but bias in story choice/headlines might be important.

To check a story, look to the fact-checking websites.  My favorites are http://www.factcheck.org/ (least biased, factual: very high),  https://www.snopes.com/ (least biased, factual: high), and https://www.politifact.com/ (least biased, factual: high).

Recent letters fail basic fact-checking tests. We start with Sam Prentice, who reiterates claims that Biden promoted election fraud.  Snopes says this is False.  (http://sauyet.com/link/1)  It's like claiming the police's Homicide Squad is there to commit homicides.  Or he misquotes Biden's, "I don't only need you to get me elected; I need you once I'm elected" by dropping the "only", which he would have realized if he read Politifact (http://sauyet.com/link/2).  The remainder of the letter is similarly absurd, but it's worth countering that the 81 million people voted either *for* the candidate who kept us safe by following health guidelines, or the *against* the one whose superspreader rallies risked more deaths.

The letter from George Kitchin gets just one thing right.  Snopes will tell you (http://sauyet.com/link/3), that yes, those notorious cages were built under Obama.  But, as FactCheck points out (http://sauyet.com/link/4), the blanket policy causing vast family separations was Trump's'.  His claim about Gold Star families is laughable.  It was all over the news, and there's a whole Wikipedia page about it (http://sauyet.com/link/5), as is his notion that Trump only insulted reporters under massive provocation (reporting demonstrable lies is not insulting.)  For just one example, see http://sauyet.com/link/6.  As to his absurdities on the ACA and Covid, remember that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  Where's his evidence?

And of course there's Ed Kozlowski, the poor dear, who must have been bullied by a progressive during his childhood.  His letter presents no facts to dispute.
