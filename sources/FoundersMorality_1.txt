Sam Prentice wants you to believe that progressivism has lead to the a decline of morality and civil virtue.  He hearkens back to his high school days and its rifle club.  I wonder if the coach would have approved of the widespread adoption of assault rifles.  I wonder what he would think about the fact that 
a 2019 NIH study showed that, "A 10% increase in state gun ownership was associated with a 35.1% higher rate of mass shootings." (http://link.sauyet.com/76)

He repeats his lie that we are not a democracy, even though it's been debunked on these pages (e.g. https://letters.sauyet.com/#/2020-11-20/.)  Again, the U.S. is both a republic (because we have no monarch) and a representative democracy (because we elect our lawmakers and executives.)  It's that simple.

He also hearkens back to our founding era, with a long quote from one of the few actively religious founders, John Adams.  When he tells us how our nuclear families and our morality has slipped, let's look at U.S. families in 1790.  First off, nearly 20% of adults in this country could not marry at all.  They were bred like cattle, could be raped at will by their owners, worked to death, and killed with impunity.  Another 40% could be forced into marriage by their male relatives, were forbidden to own property, and again, could be raped at will by their husbands.  Children were forced to work at ages we would consider scandalous.

If, as he says, it's progressivism that has moved us from that era, then I'm all for it.

As to "depraved perversion run amok", I'd have to hear details.  I think we have very different ideas about depravity.

It's worth quoting another founder, Thomas Paine: "I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and in endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy."  That sounds very much like progressivism to me.
