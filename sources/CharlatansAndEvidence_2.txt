Sam Prentice defends Tony Heller from charges of being a charlatan.  Heller runs the blog https://realclimatescience.com/, a site rated Conspiracy-Pseudoscience and Quakery (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/).  It is possible that Heller is not a charlatan.  If he believes the nonsense he's peddling, he's not a charlatan, only a badly informed menace.  But he convinces the gullible that he understands NASA's and NOAA's data better than NASA and NOAA and won't listen to rebuttals.  He sounds like a charlatan.

Mr. Prentice says I never back up my claims and in the next sentence complains about URLs I post.  Sam, those *are* evidence backing up my claims!  I try to use easy-to-type URLS in my letters.  For instance, I added the link to the fact-check above.  Now you can type just http://link.sauyet.com/77.  If you don't trust me on this, I just added a mechanism to let you append '/preview' to them.  Visiting http://link.sauyet.com/77/preview, you will see the actual URL, and can decide whether to click on that link.

By the way, his letter -- falsely chiding me for not providing evidence -- itself provides no evidence.  Don't you love irony?  Let's take one of his claims and look at the evidence.  He starts by saying Joe Biden is the worst president in history.  Of course this is opinion, but there are experts asked to evaluate presidential performance.  I know of only one that covers Biden, the 2022 Sienna poll (overview: http://link.sauyet.com/78, data: http://link.sauyet.com/79.)  This ranks Biden number 19, well in the top half.  Trump, by contrast, is 43rd out of 45.  The other three surveys covering Trump place him 41st, 42nd, and 44th out of 44.  (Details online: http://letters.sauyet.com/#2023-05-26).  While Sam Prentice sees Biden as the worst, the experts see him as above average, and see Trump among the worst.

I respond so often to Prentice's ridiculous outbursts on climate because this is *the* defining crisis of our time.  I want my grandchildren to inherit a livable world.  We're on a path away from them.  The nonsense that Heller is promoting, and Prentice is parroting, could keep us from finding a better path.
