As the Rivereast letter deadline approaches, it's looking increasingly possible that the Republican party will elect Jim Jordan as Speaker of the House.

It's looking increasingly possible that we're looking at the end of two and a half centuries of democracy in our nation. It's looking increasingly possible that we will slowly cede our republican government to a modern form of fascism.

Jim Jordan is a legislator who's spent sixteen years in office, and yet has created no legislation. Not a single bill. The Center for Effective Lawmaking places him below 99% of his peers.

Jim Jordan was a coach who overlooked the sexual harassment of his wrestling team members. Jim Jordan was the closest ally in the House to Donald Trump and strived to overturn a fair election. Jim Jordan is bound and determined to hold hostage our country's full faith and credit in order to win concessions on his pet issues.

In short Jim Jordan is a menace. And yet he's the Republican's best candidate for Speaker?

This is the modern Republican party: entirely dysfunctional but bound and determined to hold onto power by any means necessary, even if they destroy all democratic norms to do so.

But you can do something about this, even if Jordan becomes Speaker. You can vote out Republicans at all levels of government. If you have a local election next month, vote Democrat, vote Independent, vote Green, vote Libertarian. If you love your country, vote anything but Republican.

If, like me, you live in Andover, consider the Democrat's slate of incredibly competent, compassionate, and experienced candidates. (I could use your support as well in running for the RHAM Board.) The best thing you could do for your country is to vote against every Republican running anywhere until the party comes to its senses. If we do this, perhaps we can make it look increasingly possible that our country can heal from the divisions Newt Gingrich started and modern Republicans are trying to finish. Vote Democratic!
