People ask why I bother responding to Sam Prentice.  "After all, he's just another loony, right?  He's just a conspiracy theorist whose theories aren't even coherent, never mind credible, isn't he?"  Well, perhaps.

But unlike some of his peers (and we won't mention Colin McNamara, Frank Blume, or Ed Kozlowski by name, ok?) whose nonsense at the very worst might convince us to vote for the wrong politician or party, Mr. Prentice's rants are downright dangerous.  If his nonsense holds sway among our policy leaders, we further delay or reverse progress fighting the climate crisis.  There's a realistic chance of that, since the entire Republican party in D.C. has bought into it.

So why respond?  Well, truth should never be silent when falsehood is shouting.

But sometimes it's hard to bother.  His most recent diatribe -- that CO2 is so beneficial we should embrace its increase -- is farcical.  He points back fifty million years, back when the Arctic Circle was a swamp, and sea levels were 250 feet higher.  That's his Eden?

So why respond?  Well, the arrogance is hard to stand.  He brazenly calls everyone who disagrees with him -- including the military, insurance companies, coastal states such as Florida and Texas, and the overwhelming majority of the scientific establishment -- uneducated buffoons.

Notice also his sleight of hand here.  A decade ago, he argued that the Earth was not warming.  Five years later, he admitted it was, but claimed human-released C02 was not responsible for it.  Now he just wants to say that it will be beneficial to us.  This is a decision looking for justification after justification, flailing as each one is undermined.

So why respond?  Well, I have a brand-new grandson.  I want his generation to inherit from us a garden.  Not a wasteland.
