Sam Prentice says that I "unintentionally rail against meritocracy."  Do you believe him?  The letter he was presumably responding to is at http://letters.sauyet.com/#/2021-11-05/.  Go ahead and read it; I'll wait...

No?  You found no sign of railing about anything, perhaps?  And no critique of meritocracy?  Please don't be surprised.  This is Mr. Prentice's *modus operandi*: to invent a straw man, fail to knock down even that, then pretend that no one will notice his sleight of hand.

"People," he says, "who see everything through the prism of skin color are the true racists."  Could be.  Do you know anyone like that?  I certainly don't.  But we've all met people who deny that current and past racism has anything significant to do with inequalities.  It sounds as though Mr. Prentice is treading close to that line.

It was interesting that the same day I read Mr. Prentice's note on meritocracy, I happened upon a reference to an academmic paper (https://link.sauyet.com/34) which explained that among White students admitted to Harvard, 43% are admitted because they are athletes or the children of alumni, staff, or donors, and not because of academic merit.  For non-White students, that number is no more than 16%.  Given how many doors are opened by degrees from a prestigious university, we can see still one more example of how structural racism perpetuates racial inequality.  The world is full of such examples.  Noting and reporting them is not racism.  Denying them often is.

And finally, we have to note the odd obsession Sam Prentice and other conservatives have with the Democratic party.  Sixty years ago, the parties swapped places in their approach to race; today the vast majority of African-Americans find the Democratic party the more congenial home.  For me, a progressive, I simply prefer the parties with more progressive agendas, and am not particularly worried about what they stood for in the 19th century.
