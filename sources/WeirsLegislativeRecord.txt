Some weeks ago, I received a flier from Steve Weir touting his legislative accomplishments representing the 55th State House District.  Let's take a look.

He starts with a list of bills that *didn't* pass this session.  It is slightly odd, but not inconceivable, that one's strongest accomplishment is in blocking bills from passing.  So, was he a master manipulator who targeted some terrible bills, managing the sausage-making and causing all five of these bills to go down?  Well, no.  These bills passed through committee (over his objection), but not one of them made it to a floor vote.  Steve Weir had little to do with them failing.

Then he gushes about seven bills that did become law.  Was this his great legislative achievement, shepherding tough bills through Hartford's meat-grinder?  Again, no.  With one exception, these bills were passed *unanimously*.  That one? 146-3 in the House, 36-0 in the Senate.

So Steve's proud accomplishments are losing some committee votes on bills that never reached the floor and boldly siding with every one of his colleagues on some others?  Is this really what we want our legislators to be proud of?  To my mind a successful legislator is one who can help pass the difficult bills, one who can sway colleagues with superior logic, even one who goes down swinging, forcing others to at least *understand* the objections.

Elsewhere in the flier we learn that Steve loves children and librarians.  Bully for him!  And we learn a little about vanity: the flier contains fourteen separate photos of Steve.  But mostly it's about these legislative so-called accomplishments.  What a waste of paper.

I, for one, do not want to be represented by a drone.  I want a queen bee.  So I'm proudly supporting Amanda V for the 55th!
