Dinesh D'Souza is being cited as a relevant source on voter fraud.  I suppose there's something to that, as he was himself convicted of voter fraud.  But when he becomes the producer of last resort for political activists pushing their latest voting conspiracy theory, it's hard not to just laugh.

Sam Prentice cites D'Souza's new film, 2000 Mules, as incontrovertible evidence of a vast conspiracy to alter the 2020 vote.  The film is based on the work of True the Vote, a Tea Party offshoot that specializes in challenging voters rights.  I have not seen the film, and I doubt Mr. Prentice had when he cited it, since as far as I can tell, it wasn't even released until after his letter was published.  But I've seen its trailer and Charlie Kirk's fawning, hour-long interview with its principals.

They make some interesting accusations.  Without access to their data and methodology (which they say they'll release after the film's run) it's hard to make any substantive judgments about the material.  But it is clearly based on data too coarse to prove their main point -- cellphone ping data is not that precise.  That makes the rest of it suspect, and when they start preaching about vast conspiracies involving many layers of law enforcemeament, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and various governors, it feels more and more like a sick joke.  I really wonder if they've done the basic statistical step of creating a null hypothesis and measuring their results agains that.  Somehow I doubt it.  I'm also curious as to whether they have any reason whatsoever to suggest any illegal votes benefitted Biden over Trump.  I guess we'll see.

Of course Mr. Prentice believes it.  Confirmation bias is quite powerful; when conspiracy theorists start spouting a new conspiracy it will attract all sorts of gullible souls.  Don't be too angry with them; they mostly deserve our pity.
