C. Anne Johnson has again failed Fact-Checking 101.

The recent case before the Supreme Court is *Murthy vs. Missouri*.  The Court seems likely to overturn it, as the effect of that decision is forbid most government contact with social media companies.  The ostensible problem it was solving was that the government was asking companies like Facebook and Twitter to stop promoting false and dangerous misinformation about topics like Covid and elections.

The 5th Circuit accepted the ridiculous notion that this is censorship.  Both platforms -- and I assume others like Instagram and TikTok as well -- had policies of not promoting clear falsehoods that threatened public harm.  All the government was doing was calling attention to such content.  This rarely involved taking down these posts; usually it meant adding warning labels and/or avoiding oversharing such posts.  Generally, only posts specifically advocating violence are removed.

This is not censorship.  Censorship is *the government* preventing people from speaking their minds.  Helping social media companies identify dangerous, false posts is not censorship.  The First Amendment doesn't grant you the right to publish whatever you want on a social media site... unless you own one.  It doesn't even grant you the right to publish letters in *The Rivereast*.  That's up to its editors and owners.  Facebook and Twitter CEOs actually *asked*  Congress for regulations.

HR-4310 -- a bipartisan bill, by the way -- does not promote propaganda inside the US.  Reputable fact-checkers have already debunked this, which Ms. Johnson could easily have found out if she'd bothered looking.  All Section 1078 says is that the Voice of America, which broadcasts overseas to promote freedom and democracy, can make its materials available for a reasonable fee to domestic publishing organizations.  Voice of America is not authorized to broadcast in the U.S.
