Fact-checking is not a difficult process.  When you hear something that makes your blood boil, before repeating it, see it it passes muster.  Check your sources with https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/, a comprehensive listing of media sources, their biases, and their accuracy.  An outlet like like https://www.oann.com/ (questionable source, factual: low) can be safely ignored.  One like https://www.washingtonpost.com/ (left-center bias, factual: high), can be counted on for the facts, but bias in story choice or headlines might be important.

If you want to check a story, look to the fact-checking websites.  My favorites are http://www.factcheck.org/ (least biased, factual: very high),  https://www.snopes.com/ (least biased, factual: high), and https://www.politifact.com/ (least biased, factual: high).

Several recent letters fail the basic fact-checking tests. We can start with Sam Prentice, who reiterates claims that Biden promoted election fraud by taking a quote out of context.  Snopes will tell you that this is False.  (http://sauyet.com/link/1)  It's sort of like claiming that the goal of the police's Homicide Squad is to commit homicides.  Or he misquotes Biden's, "I don't only need you to get me elected; I need you once I'm elected" by dropping the "only", which he would have realized if he read Politifact (http://sauyet.com/link/2).  The remainder of the letter is similarly absurd, but it's worth countering that the 81 million people voted either *for* the candidate who followed health guidelines and tried to keep us safe or the *against* the one who who risked more deaths with superspreader rallies.

The letter from George Kitchin gets one thing right, while still mostly being wrong.  Snopes will tell you (http://sauyet.com/link/3), that yes, the cages that eventually housed the immigrant children were built under Obama.  But as FactCheck points out (http://sauyet.com/link/4), the blanket policy that led to the vast number of family separations was a Trump executive order.  His claim about Gold Star families is laughable.  It was all over the news, and there's a whole Wikipedia page about it (http://sauyet.com/link/5), as too is his notion that Trump only insulted reporters under massive provocation (reporting his demonstrable lies is not insulting him.)  For just one example, see him insulting a disabled reporter at http://sauyet.com/link/6.  As to his absurdities on the ACA and Covid, remember that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  I'd like to see any proof his these contentions.

And of course there's Ed Kozlowski, the poor dear, who must have been bullied by a progressive during his childhood.  But his later presents no facts to dispute.
