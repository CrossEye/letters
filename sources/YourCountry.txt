*This your country*:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We the people of the United States... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

A new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Lafayette, we are here. Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!

*This is your country under Trump*:

Covfefe. Inject you some bleach. Very fine people on both sides. This so-called judge. Grab them by the pu**y. When you're a star, they let you do it. Covfefe. The largest audience to ever witness an inauguration. Alternative facts. Journalists are the enemy of the people. Just remember what you’re seeing and what you're reading is not what’s happening. Fake news! Covfefe.

Mexico will pay for it. If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her. No, I would not protect certain NATO allies; I would encourage Russia to do whatever the hell they want. Covfefe! Crooked Hillary, Lyin' Ted, Low Energy Jeb, Jeff Flakey, Sleepy Joe, Crazy Bernie, Little Marco, Shifty Schiff, Wacky Jacky, Phony Fani, Pocahontas, Crazy Bernie. Americans who died in war are losers and suckers. McCain is not a war hero; I like people who weren't captured. Covfefe, Covfefe, COVFEFE!
