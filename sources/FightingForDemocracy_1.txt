It is time to fight back.

The chaos emanating from Washington is causing havoc in small-town Connecticut.  We've all heard what's going on: the bullying, the lies, the incompetence, the cruelty.  Especially the cruelty. They want us to feel powerless in the face of this onslaught.  But we are not powerless.  We're Americans, and this government belongs to us!

Connecticut officials are leading the charge against the immoral and illegal depredations of the Musk Administration.  We can help.

The Marlborough and Andover Democrats have teamed up.  We're bringing together state leaders to describe how these issues are affecting us all, what our officials are doing to counter the problems, and how residents can push back.  We are holding a Defending Democracy Forum on Sunday, April 26, from 3 - 5 PM ats the Marlborough Elementary School.

Featured will be Lieutenant Governor Susan Bysiewicz and State Senators Cathy Osten and MD Rahman.  This event is open to residents of Andover, Bolton, Columbia, Hebron, and Marlborough. More information is at https://defending.ahmdems.org/.

If you're a veteran losing benefits to the DOGE cuts... if you're a senior who has to travel two hours because you're no longer allowed to simply call the Social Security office... if you have children attending schools as Trump tries to shutter the Department of education... if you value the freedom of the press... if you believe it immoral to persecute others because they disagree with you... if your costs are skyrocketing because of a petulant president's tariff tantrums... then you can fight back.

Come join us to learn how.
