Someone is pulling a fast one.

Many ballot questions for Andover's proposed charter changes ask one thing but mean something entirely different. Questions 7 – 10 are out-and-out lies.  I've posted http://charter.andoverct.info/2024/ describing the charter changes, but if you want the original sources, you can see the actual charter changes at http://link.sauyet.com/120 and the ballot questions at http://link.sauyet.com/121.

Read Questions 7 – 10, then read the changes to sections 802 and 803, and then try to figure out which changes are tied to which questions.  Try perhaps to answer these questions:

    1. Which ballot question is tied to the deletion of Sections 802B(2) and 802B(3), the sections that described the format of the budget presented to the Town Meeting?

    2. Which ballot question replaces the Board of Finance with the Town Administrator as the recipient of the departments' expenditure estimates? (802C)

    3. Which ballot question necessitates the new 802D, which replaces the BOF budget hearing with a joint BOS/BOF meeting, at which the presence of just three Selectmen would constitute a quorum?

Don't worry if you can't do it.  The Board of Selectmen couldn't do it either at their public hearing Monday.  Instead, they just asked you to trust them.  Remember Reagan's dictum?  "Trust, but verify.s"  Well I've done the verification myself.  The questions don't come *close* to describing the relevant changes.  Don't take my word, though.  Please check it out for yourself.

The worst part of this is that most of those questions on their own suggest reasonable changes.  By not describing the actual charter changes involved, they are trying to fool us.  Don't be taken in.

Also, don't let them take away your right to vote for the Town Clerk (Question 6), or to weigh in on town ordinances (Question 11.)

Vote No on 6 – 11!
