Don Denley notes that I do not recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  He's quite right.  I stand respectfully, but I do not speak the words.  Perhaps I owe an explanation.

Nearly four decades ago, when I became a Quaker, I took to heart their teachings against taking oaths.  The Quaker view is that we should not have two kinds of truths: everyday ones and those we really mean because we swear to them.  Quakers take Jesus' words seriously: "But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool..." (*Matthew 5:34-35*).  These concerns by Quakers and other like-minded citizens are built into our laws.  The right to affirm rather than swear is in the Constitution; it is also in the very first section of U.S. Legal code.

The Pledge of Allegiance is an oath.  I do not take oaths.  The right not to do so was affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1943.  Mr. Denley's implication that I must do so because the RHAM BOE operates under Roberts Rules is fairly bizarre.  Roberts Rules mention this only as a potential opening ceremony, and certainly do not insist that anyone participates.  His implication that I bring dishonor to Andover by not participating demonstrates a terrible misunderstanding of honor.

However, were I a person who did take oaths, the Pledge would remain problematic to me.  To give allegiance to a person or an idea makes sense.  To give it to a symbol does not.  Nor does it make sense to give credence to the McCarthy-era Red Scare fearmongering about "godless Communists" by speaking aloud the 1950's era awkward addition of "under God".

Finally, it is very odd to be chided over this by a self-described conservative.  Conservatives generally promote individual freedom and deplore any form of collectivism.  Why is Mr. Denley bothered that I refuse to participate in a ritual designed to coerce uniformity of belief?
