Ed Kozlowski is a funny guy.  We could discuss Ken Hjulstrom's fantasy or Michael Chotkowski's wretchedly confused nonsense, but I'll focus on Mr. Kowlowski's screed.  After all, it's refreshing that he presents actual content instead of his usual vacuity.  That content is false, but still it's an improvement.

First, he won't scare me by claiming to be good at mathematics.  I have a two math degreess. 

Second, we need to explain something to those who don't understand math... or economics... or government... or much else:  A president's first budget takes effect October 1st.  Earlier economic effects are the result of their predecessor or of factors outside Presidential control.  Perhaps the fairest comparison is between the 27 months starting with those Octobers.  Including the mishandled pandemic period would be infinitely worse for Trump. 

Mr. Kozlowski focuses on inflation.  It's risen faster under Biden (by 4.7% annually) than in recent years, but is below the increase in wages (up 5.1% per year).  Most people are better off.  However yes: food's gone up faster (6.9%) than wages.  Job creation, though, was twice as fast for Biden than for Trump.

It's amusing that he'd blame Biden for lumber prices, which are due to booming home improvements during the Covid lockdown and to Trump's' tariffs on Canadian lumber.  But it's hilarious because since the start of Biden's first budget, lumber prices have *fallen* 8.6% annually, where they rose to crazy heights during Trump's budgets, doubling before settling down.

He claims spiraling debt; funny, it rose 8.3% per year under Biden, 8.9% per year under Trump.  He blames Biden for the invasion of Ukraine, when everyone know that Trump's puppet-master, Putin, wss responsible.  He mentions a Biden gaffe; the continuing stream of gaffes from Trump is infinitely worse.

Yeah, a funny guy all right.
