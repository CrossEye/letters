A debate rages in Rivereast letters.  Marcie Miner suggests we stop arguing about politics, offering alternative suggestions.  Her agenda is unquestionably progressive: supporting seniors, children, the poor, the hungry, the addicted, and removing money from politics.  That pure progressivism is what one side of this debate promotes.

This debate is important.  When the other side wins the debate, the Supreme Court selects Bush over Gore, we get Roberts and Alito on the Supreme Court, and its Citizen's United decision ends campaign finance reform.  Progressives seek to change this; conservatives *like* it when the rich dominate our system.

This debate is crucial.  When the other side wins the debate, it is captured by Donald Trump and his attempt to tear down democratic institutions, leading to our country's greatest crisis since the Civil War.  I remember when conservatives discussed spreading freedom and democracy around the world.  Now they claim the U.S. has never been a democracy.  Their idea of freedom is the right for their children to hear no history that makes them uncomfortable and the right to bring guns wherever they choose, even if we sacrifice some innocent high-schoolers.

This debate is a matter of life and death.  When the other side wins the debate, we drop any attempt to curb global warming.  We're burning down the world we should be tending for our children.  To appease its fossil-fuel donors, conservatives would sacrifice the health and safety of coming generations.

This does not describe all conservatives -- hello Georgette! --but it has become the dominant ideology of the husk of conservatism and the remains of the Republican party.  To defeat it, progressives must win the debate and change minds.  So no, don't stop arguing.  It's a necessary first step to our safety, to our survival.
