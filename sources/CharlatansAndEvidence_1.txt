Sam Prentice tries to defend Tony Heller from charges of being a charlatan.  Heller runs the blog https://realclimatescience.com/.  Media watchdogs rate this site as Conspiracy-Pseudoscience, with a Moderate conspiracy rating and the highest level of pseudoscience, Quakery (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/real-climate-science/).  Now is it possible that Heller is not a charlatan?  Yes, of course, if he believes the nonsense he's peddling, I guess that means he's not a charlatan, only a badly informed menace.  But he does convince the gullible that he understands NASA's and NOAA's data better than NASA and NOAA and all the actual experts.  And he won't listen to rebuttals about it.  It definitely sounds like the work of a charlatan.

Mr. Prentice says I never back up my claims, and in the very next sentence he complains about the URLs I post.  Sam, those *are* evidence backing up the claims!  I made a very simple link page on my site so that I can add easier-to-type URLS in my letters.  For instance, I just added the link to the fact-check above.  So now you have to type only http://link.sauyet.com/77 to visit it.  One could use bit.ly or tinyurl.com instead, but even those are hard to type with the mixed case opaque strings.  But if you don't trust me on this, I just added a mechanism to let you append '/preview' to one of these URLs.  Now if you go to http://link.sauyet.com/77/preview, you will see the actual URL, and can choose to click on that link or not.

By the way, his letter -- falsely chiding me for not providing evidence -- itself provides no evidence.  Don't you love irony?  So let's take one of his claims and look at the evidence.  He starts by saying Joe Biden is the worst president in history.  Now of course this is a judgment call, but there are experts asked to weigh in on presidential rankings.  I know of only one that covers Biden, the 2022 Sienna poll (overview: http://link.sauyet.com/78, data: http://link.sauyet.com/79.)  This ranks Biden number 19, well in the top half.  Trump, by contrast, is 43rd out of 45.  The other three surveys covering Trump place him 41st, 42nd, and 44th out of 44.  (The links are #80, #81, and #82, or see this letter online: http://letters.sauyet.com/#2023-05-26).  So while Sam Prentice sees Biden as the worst, the experts see him as above average, and see his precedecessor among the worst.


I respond so often to Prentice's ridiculous outbursts on climate because this is *the* defining crisis of our time.  I want my grandchildren to inherit a livable world.  We're on a path that could take that away from them.  The nonsense that Heller is promoting, and Prentice is parroting, could keep us from finding a better path.
