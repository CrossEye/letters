Some recent news:

Tuesday:
  * Donale John Trump falls asleep in court while a porn star testifies about an affair with him and about the coverup.
  * Joseph Robinette Biden gives a well-received speech about the most thorny foreign policy issue currently plaguing us.

Wednesday:
  * JRB announces the groundbreaking of a major new plant he helped negotiate on the grounds of the failed DJT Foxconn initiative.  (Remember the golden shovels?)

Thursday:
  * DJT grovels for campaign contributions from the oil industry, promising to roll back successful environmental initiatives.
  * JRB makes a hard decision on that thorny, party-dividing policy issue.

Sunday:
  * DJT praises Hannibal Lecter (a fictional cannibalistic serial killer) in a typical, rambling speech.

Monday:
  * DJT simply scowls as he listens to his former lawyer implicate him in illegal activity.

Anyone who thinks that Trump would be better than Biden has a short memory and has not been following the news.  Anyone claiming little difference between the Republicans and the Democrats is clearly not paying attention; there is no UniParty.
