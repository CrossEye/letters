Longtime Rivereast letter readers will recognize that the spirit of Robert Kodym's fascinating prose survives, this time in the form of a recent letter from Pat Schmidt.  I would love to write a rebuttal here, but it's entirely unclear what the writer is talking about.

Except here: one phrase is very clear, and very frightening: "There is no definitive truth to anything these days."

That anyone would actually say that publicly scares the pants off me.  That there are people out there who believe it should terrify us all.  It means that the assault on reason of the Bush, Jr. administration has succeeded and the further attack on truth itself championed by Trump and his minions is taking hold.

This is the stuff of despots.  It's the "Only I can fix it" mentality carried to its logical end.  It leads to, "I don't have to listen to your evidence; I know I'm right," with that supposed knowledge coming coming from those who cannot be questioned.  It's what lets the letter-writer put scare-quotes around "statistics", because of course facts must be flexible.  Once again, Orwell's quote seems prescient: "[The totalitarians] told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command."

I can't tell if the letter's headline, "The Truth Will Prevail" represents the writer's own irony or is a copy-editor's version of whistling past the graveyard.

In fact, there is truth, and there are real techniques for finding it.  But all of them require a first step that seems to be beyond too many people.  First, you need to open your mind.
