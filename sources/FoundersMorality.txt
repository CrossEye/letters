Sam Prentice is confused.  He wants you to believe that progressivism has led to declining morality and civil virtue.  He hearkens back to his high school rifle club.  I wonder if the coach would have approved of the widespread adoption of assault rifles.  What would that coach think about the fact that a 2019 study showed that, "A 10% increase in state gun ownership was associated with a 35.1% higher rate of mass shootings." (http://link.sauyet.com/76)

He repeats his lie that we are not a democracy, even though it's been debunked already (https://letters.sauyet.com/#/2020-11-20/.)  Again, the U.S. is both a republic (because we have no monarch) and a representative democracy (because we elect our lawmakers and executives.)  They're simple definitions.

He also hearkens back to our founding era, quoting one of the few actively religious founders, John Adams.  He claims our nuclear families and our morality have slipped.  Let's look at U.S. families in 1790.  First off, nearly 20% of adults in this country could not marry at all.  They were bred like cattle, could be raped at will by their owners, worked to death, and killed with impunity.  Another 40% could be forced into marriage by their male relatives, were forbidden to own property, and again, could be raped at will by their husbands.  Children were forced to work at ages we would consider scandalous.

If it's progressivism that has moved us from that era, then I'm all for it.

As to "depraved perversion run amok", I'd have to hear details.  I think we have very different ideas about depravity.

It's worth quoting another founder, Thomas Paine: "I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and in endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy."  That sounds very much like progressivism to me.
