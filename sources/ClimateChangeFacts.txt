Victor Congdon informs us that politicians should not be involved in discussions of climate change.  He's right that they should have no input into the scientific discussions of what's happening.  But our representatives are essential to determining policy.  The trouble is that climate change denialism has slipped into public policy for far too long.  Instead of listening to the science, many policymakers start by denying the it.  It gets worse from there.

The science is clear, and some of Mr. Congdon's points bear occasional resemblence to these truths.  Others are complete nonsense.  Gary Gile gets into this act too, directing us to his website where he disclaims common news sources and fact-checkers and promotes a convicted Ponzi-schemer and a quack doctor.  It's no wonder that he thinks conspiracy theory is simply in the eye of the beholder; his sources are full of them.

CO2 is of course essential to life on earth, but its sudden increase in the past 100 years has been the largest factor in the increasingly warm global temperatures.  Of course CO2 concentrations have been higher in the distant past, but -- call me parochial -- I'm much more interested in the environment during humanity's time.

Crackpots are occasionally found to be right.  But don't bet your life on it.  Or our world.

The most comprehensive source of information on human-caused climate change is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (https://www.ipcc.ch).  If  you want to find out whether that Facebook post you just saw on climate change is accurate, I'd recommend Climate Feedback (https://climatefeedback.org/).  If instead you rely on proven liars like Martin Armstrong, you're headed right off the cliff with the other lemmings.
